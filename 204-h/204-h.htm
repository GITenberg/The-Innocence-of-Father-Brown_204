    <h2>
      The Blue Cross
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between the silver ribbon of morning and the green glittering ribbon of
      sea, the boat touched Harwich and let loose a swarm of folk like flies,
      among whom the man we must follow was by no means conspicuous&mdash;nor
      wished to be. There was nothing notable about him, except a slight
      contrast between the holiday gaiety of his clothes and the official
      gravity of his face. His clothes included a slight, pale grey jacket, a
      white waistcoat, and a silver straw hat with a grey-blue ribbon. His lean
      face was dark by contrast, and ended in a curt black beard that looked
      Spanish and suggested an Elizabethan ruff. He was smoking a cigarette with
      the seriousness of an idler. There was nothing about him to indicate the
      fact that the grey jacket covered a loaded revolver, that the white
      waistcoat covered a police card, or that the straw hat covered one of the
      most powerful intellects in Europe. For this was Valentin himself, the
      head of the Paris police and the most famous investigator of the world;
      and he was coming from Brussels to London to make the greatest arrest of
      the century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau was in England. The police of three countries had tracked the
      great criminal at last from Ghent to Brussels, from Brussels to the Hook
      of Holland; and it was conjectured that he would take some advantage of
      the unfamiliarity and confusion of the Eucharistic Congress, then taking
      place in London. Probably he would travel as some minor clerk or secretary
      connected with it; but, of course, Valentin could not be certain; nobody
      could be certain about Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is many years now since this colossus of crime suddenly ceased keeping
      the world in a turmoil; and when he ceased, as they said after the death
      of Roland, there was a great quiet upon the earth. But in his best days (I
      mean, of course, his worst) Flambeau was a figure as statuesque and
      international as the Kaiser. Almost every morning the daily paper
      announced that he had escaped the consequences of one extraordinary crime
      by committing another. He was a Gascon of gigantic stature and bodily
      daring; and the wildest tales were told of his outbursts of athletic
      humour; how he turned the juge d&rsquo;instruction upside down and stood him on
      his head, &ldquo;to clear his mind&rdquo;; how he ran down the Rue de Rivoli with a
      policeman under each arm. It is due to him to say that his fantastic
      physical strength was generally employed in such bloodless though
      undignified scenes; his real crimes were chiefly those of ingenious and
      wholesale robbery. But each of his thefts was almost a new sin, and would
      make a story by itself. It was he who ran the great Tyrolean Dairy Company
      in London, with no dairies, no cows, no carts, no milk, but with some
      thousand subscribers. These he served by the simple operation of moving
      the little milk cans outside people&rsquo;s doors to the doors of his own
      customers. It was he who had kept up an unaccountable and close
      correspondence with a young lady whose whole letter-bag was intercepted,
      by the extraordinary trick of photographing his messages infinitesimally
      small upon the slides of a microscope. A sweeping simplicity, however,
      marked many of his experiments. It is said that he once repainted all the
      numbers in a street in the dead of night merely to divert one traveller
      into a trap. It is quite certain that he invented a portable pillar-box,
      which he put up at corners in quiet suburbs on the chance of strangers
      dropping postal orders into it. Lastly, he was known to be a startling
      acrobat; despite his huge figure, he could leap like a grasshopper and
      melt into the tree-tops like a monkey. Hence the great Valentin, when he
      set out to find Flambeau, was perfectly aware that his adventures would
      not end when he had found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how was he to find him? On this the great Valentin&rsquo;s ideas were still
      in process of settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one thing which Flambeau, with all his dexterity of disguise,
      could not cover, and that was his singular height. If Valentin&rsquo;s quick eye
      had caught a tall apple-woman, a tall grenadier, or even a tolerably tall
      duchess, he might have arrested them on the spot. But all along his train
      there was nobody that could be a disguised Flambeau, any more than a cat
      could be a disguised giraffe. About the people on the boat he had already
      satisfied himself; and the people picked up at Harwich or on the journey
      limited themselves with certainty to six. There was a short railway
      official travelling up to the terminus, three fairly short market
      gardeners picked up two stations afterwards, one very short widow lady
      going up from a small Essex town, and a very short Roman Catholic priest
      going up from a small Essex village. When it came to the last case,
      Valentin gave it up and almost laughed. The little priest was so much the
      essence of those Eastern flats; he had a face as round and dull as a
      Norfolk dumpling; he had eyes as empty as the North Sea; he had several
      brown paper parcels, which he was quite incapable of collecting. The
      Eucharistic Congress had doubtless sucked out of their local stagnation
      many such creatures, blind and helpless, like moles disinterred. Valentin
      was a sceptic in the severe style of France, and could have no love for
      priests. But he could have pity for them, and this one might have provoked
      pity in anybody. He had a large, shabby umbrella, which constantly fell on
      the floor. He did not seem to know which was the right end of his return
      ticket. He explained with a moon-calf simplicity to everybody in the
      carriage that he had to be careful, because he had something made of real
      silver &ldquo;with blue stones&rdquo; in one of his brown-paper parcels. His quaint
      blending of Essex flatness with saintly simplicity continuously amused the
      Frenchman till the priest arrived (somehow) at Tottenham with all his
      parcels, and came back for his umbrella. When he did the last, Valentin
      even had the good nature to warn him not to take care of the silver by
      telling everybody about it. But to whomever he talked, Valentin kept his
      eye open for someone else; he looked out steadily for anyone, rich or
      poor, male or female, who was well up to six feet; for Flambeau was four
      inches above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He alighted at Liverpool Street, however, quite conscientiously secure
      that he had not missed the criminal so far. He then went to Scotland Yard
      to regularise his position and arrange for help in case of need; he then
      lit another cigarette and went for a long stroll in the streets of London.
      As he was walking in the streets and squares beyond Victoria, he paused
      suddenly and stood. It was a quaint, quiet square, very typical of London,
      full of an accidental stillness. The tall, flat houses round looked at
      once prosperous and uninhabited; the square of shrubbery in the centre
      looked as deserted as a green Pacific islet. One of the four sides was
      much higher than the rest, like a dais; and the line of this side was
      broken by one of London&rsquo;s admirable accidents&mdash;a restaurant that
      looked as if it had strayed from Soho. It was an unreasonably attractive
      object, with dwarf plants in pots and long, striped blinds of lemon yellow
      and white. It stood specially high above the street, and in the usual
      patchwork way of London, a flight of steps from the street ran up to meet
      the front door almost as a fire-escape might run up to a first-floor
      window. Valentin stood and smoked in front of the yellow-white blinds and
      considered them long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen. A few clouds
      in heaven do come together into the staring shape of one human eye. A tree
      does stand up in the landscape of a doubtful journey in the exact and
      elaborate shape of a note of interrogation. I have seen both these things
      myself within the last few days. Nelson does die in the instant of
      victory; and a man named Williams does quite accidentally murder a man
      named Williamson; it sounds like a sort of infanticide. In short, there is
      in life an element of elfin coincidence which people reckoning on the
      prosaic may perpetually miss. As it has been well expressed in the paradox
      of Poe, wisdom should reckon on the unforeseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristide Valentin was unfathomably French; and the French intelligence is
      intelligence specially and solely. He was not &ldquo;a thinking machine&rdquo;; for
      that is a brainless phrase of modern fatalism and materialism. A machine
      only is a machine because it cannot think. But he was a thinking man, and
      a plain man at the same time. All his wonderful successes, that looked
      like conjuring, had been gained by plodding logic, by clear and
      commonplace French thought. The French electrify the world not by starting
      any paradox, they electrify it by carrying out a truism. They carry a
      truism so far&mdash;as in the French Revolution. But exactly because
      Valentin understood reason, he understood the limits of reason. Only a man
      who knows nothing of motors talks of motoring without petrol; only a man
      who knows nothing of reason talks of reasoning without strong, undisputed
      first principles. Here he had no strong first principles. Flambeau had
      been missed at Harwich; and if he was in London at all, he might be
      anything from a tall tramp on Wimbledon Common to a tall toast-master at
      the Hotel Metropole. In such a naked state of nescience, Valentin had a
      view and a method of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such cases he reckoned on the unforeseen. In such cases, when he could
      not follow the train of the reasonable, he coldly and carefully followed
      the train of the unreasonable. Instead of going to the right places&mdash;banks,
      police stations, rendezvous&mdash;he systematically went to the wrong
      places; knocked at every empty house, turned down every cul de sac, went
      up every lane blocked with rubbish, went round every crescent that led him
      uselessly out of the way. He defended this crazy course quite logically.
      He said that if one had a clue this was the worst way; but if one had no
      clue at all it was the best, because there was just the chance that any
      oddity that caught the eye of the pursuer might be the same that had
      caught the eye of the pursued. Somewhere a man must begin, and it had
      better be just where another man might stop. Something about that flight
      of steps up to the shop, something about the quietude and quaintness of
      the restaurant, roused all the detective&rsquo;s rare romantic fancy and made
      him resolve to strike at random. He went up the steps, and sitting down at
      a table by the window, asked for a cup of black coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-way through the morning, and he had not breakfasted; the
      slight litter of other breakfasts stood about on the table to remind him
      of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he proceeded
      musingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking all the time
      about Flambeau. He remembered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a pair of
      nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to pay for an
      unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through a telescope
      at a comet that might destroy the world. He thought his detective brain as
      good as the criminal&rsquo;s, which was true. But he fully realised the
      disadvantage. &ldquo;The criminal is the creative artist; the detective only the
      critic,&rdquo; he said with a sour smile, and lifted his coffee cup to his lips
      slowly, and put it down very quickly. He had put salt in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the vessel from which the silvery powder had come; it was
      certainly a sugar-basin; as unmistakably meant for sugar as a
      champagne-bottle for champagne. He wondered why they should keep salt in
      it. He looked to see if there were any more orthodox vessels. Yes; there
      were two salt-cellars quite full. Perhaps there was some speciality in the
      condiment in the salt-cellars. He tasted it; it was sugar. Then he looked
      round at the restaurant with a refreshed air of interest, to see if there
      were any other traces of that singular artistic taste which puts the sugar
      in the salt-cellars and the salt in the sugar-basin. Except for an odd
      splash of some dark fluid on one of the white-papered walls, the whole
      place appeared neat, cheerful and ordinary. He rang the bell for the
      waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that official hurried up, fuzzy-haired and somewhat blear-eyed at
      that early hour, the detective (who was not without an appreciation of the
      simpler forms of humour) asked him to taste the sugar and see if it was up
      to the high reputation of the hotel. The result was that the waiter yawned
      suddenly and woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you play this delicate joke on your customers every morning?&rdquo; inquired
      Valentin. &ldquo;Does changing the salt and sugar never pall on you as a jest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter, when this irony grew clearer, stammeringly assured him that
      the establishment had certainly no such intention; it must be a most
      curious mistake. He picked up the sugar-basin and looked at it; he picked
      up the salt-cellar and looked at that, his face growing more and more
      bewildered. At last he abruptly excused himself, and hurrying away,
      returned in a few seconds with the proprietor. The proprietor also
      examined the sugar-basin and then the salt-cellar; the proprietor also
      looked bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the waiter seemed to grow inarticulate with a rush of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I zink,&rdquo; he stuttered eagerly, &ldquo;I zink it is those two clergy-men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What two clergymen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two clergymen,&rdquo; said the waiter, &ldquo;that threw soup at the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Threw soup at the wall?&rdquo; repeated Valentin, feeling sure this must be
      some singular Italian metaphor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the attendant excitedly, and pointed at the dark splash
      on the white paper; &ldquo;threw it over there on the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin looked his query at the proprietor, who came to his rescue with
      fuller reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite true, though I don&rsquo;t suppose it has
      anything to do with the sugar and salt. Two clergymen came in and drank
      soup here very early, as soon as the shutters were taken down. They were
      both very quiet, respectable people; one of them paid the bill and went
      out; the other, who seemed a slower coach altogether, was some minutes
      longer getting his things together. But he went at last. Only, the instant
      before he stepped into the street he deliberately picked up his cup, which
      he had only half emptied, and threw the soup slap on the wall. I was in
      the back room myself, and so was the waiter; so I could only rush out in
      time to find the wall splashed and the shop empty. It don&rsquo;t do any
      particular damage, but it was confounded cheek; and I tried to catch the
      men in the street. They were too far off though; I only noticed they went
      round the next corner into Carstairs Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective was on his feet, hat settled and stick in hand. He had
      already decided that in the universal darkness of his mind he could only
      follow the first odd finger that pointed; and this finger was odd enough.
      Paying his bill and clashing the glass doors behind him, he was soon
      swinging round into the other street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that even in such fevered moments his eye was cool and
      quick. Something in a shop-front went by him like a mere flash; yet he
      went back to look at it. The shop was a popular greengrocer and
      fruiterer&rsquo;s, an array of goods set out in the open air and plainly
      ticketed with their names and prices. In the two most prominent
      compartments were two heaps, of oranges and of nuts respectively. On the
      heap of nuts lay a scrap of cardboard, on which was written in bold, blue
      chalk, &ldquo;Best tangerine oranges, two a penny.&rdquo; On the oranges was the
      equally clear and exact description, &ldquo;Finest Brazil nuts, 4d. a lb.&rdquo; M.
      Valentin looked at these two placards and fancied he had met this highly
      subtle form of humour before, and that somewhat recently. He drew the
      attention of the red-faced fruiterer, who was looking rather sullenly up
      and down the street, to this inaccuracy in his advertisements. The
      fruiterer said nothing, but sharply put each card into its proper place.
      The detective, leaning elegantly on his walking-cane, continued to
      scrutinise the shop. At last he said, &ldquo;Pray excuse my apparent
      irrelevance, my good sir, but I should like to ask you a question in
      experimental psychology and the association of ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced shopman regarded him with an eye of menace; but he continued
      gaily, swinging his cane, &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;why are two tickets wrongly
      placed in a greengrocer&rsquo;s shop like a shovel hat that has come to London
      for a holiday? Or, in case I do not make myself clear, what is the
      mystical association which connects the idea of nuts marked as oranges
      with the idea of two clergymen, one tall and the other short?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the tradesman stood out of his head like a snail&rsquo;s; he really
      seemed for an instant likely to fling himself upon the stranger. At last
      he stammered angrily: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you &lsquo;ave to do with it, but if
      you&rsquo;re one of their friends, you can tell &lsquo;em from me that I&rsquo;ll knock
      their silly &lsquo;eads off, parsons or no parsons, if they upset my apples
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; asked the detective, with great sympathy. &ldquo;Did they upset your
      apples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of &lsquo;em did,&rdquo; said the heated shopman; &ldquo;rolled &lsquo;em all over the
      street. I&rsquo;d &lsquo;ave caught the fool but for havin&rsquo; to pick &lsquo;em up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way did these parsons go?&rdquo; asked Valentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up that second road on the left-hand side, and then across the square,&rdquo;
       said the other promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Valentin, and vanished like a fairy. On the other side
      of the second square he found a policeman, and said: &ldquo;This is urgent,
      constable; have you seen two clergymen in shovel hats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman began to chuckle heavily. &ldquo;I &lsquo;ave, sir; and if you arst me,
      one of &lsquo;em was drunk. He stood in the middle of the road that bewildered
      that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way did they go?&rdquo; snapped Valentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took one of them yellow buses over there,&rdquo; answered the man; &ldquo;them
      that go to Hampstead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin produced his official card and said very rapidly: &ldquo;Call up two of
      your men to come with me in pursuit,&rdquo; and crossed the road with such
      contagious energy that the ponderous policeman was moved to almost agile
      obedience. In a minute and a half the French detective was joined on the
      opposite pavement by an inspector and a man in plain clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; began the former, with smiling importance, &ldquo;and what may&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin pointed suddenly with his cane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you on the top of that
      omnibus,&rdquo; he said, and was darting and dodging across the tangle of the
      traffic. When all three sank panting on the top seats of the yellow
      vehicle, the inspector said: &ldquo;We could go four times as quick in a taxi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; replied their leader placidly, &ldquo;if we only had an idea of
      where we were going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where are you going?&rdquo; asked the other, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentin smoked frowningly for a few seconds; then, removing his
      cigarette, he said: &ldquo;If you know what a man&rsquo;s doing, get in front of him;
      but if you want to guess what he&rsquo;s doing, keep behind him. Stray when he
      strays; stop when he stops; travel as slowly as he. Then you may see what
      he saw and may act as he acted. All we can do is to keep our eyes skinned
      for a queer thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of queer thing do you mean?&rdquo; asked the inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any sort of queer thing,&rdquo; answered Valentin, and relapsed into obstinate
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow omnibus crawled up the northern roads for what seemed like
      hours on end; the great detective would not explain further, and perhaps
      his assistants felt a silent and growing doubt of his errand. Perhaps,
      also, they felt a silent and growing desire for lunch, for the hours crept
      long past the normal luncheon hour, and the long roads of the North London
      suburbs seemed to shoot out into length after length like an infernal
      telescope. It was one of those journeys on which a man perpetually feels
      that now at last he must have come to the end of the universe, and then
      finds he has only come to the beginning of Tufnell Park. London died away
      in draggled taverns and dreary scrubs, and then was unaccountably born
      again in blazing high streets and blatant hotels. It was like passing
      through thirteen separate vulgar cities all just touching each other. But
      though the winter twilight was already threatening the road ahead of them,
      the Parisian detective still sat silent and watchful, eyeing the frontage
      of the streets that slid by on either side. By the time they had left
      Camden Town behind, the policemen were nearly asleep; at least, they gave
      something like a jump as Valentin leapt erect, struck a hand on each man&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and shouted to the driver to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tumbled down the steps into the road without realising why they had
      been dislodged; when they looked round for enlightenment they found
      Valentin triumphantly pointing his finger towards a window on the left
      side of the road. It was a large window, forming part of the long facade
      of a gilt and palatial public-house; it was the part reserved for
      respectable dining, and labelled &ldquo;Restaurant.&rdquo; This window, like all the
      rest along the frontage of the hotel, was of frosted and figured glass;
      but in the middle of it was a big, black smash, like a star in the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our cue at last,&rdquo; cried Valentin, waving his stick; &ldquo;the place with the
      broken window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What window? What cue?&rdquo; asked his principal assistant. &ldquo;Why, what proof
      is there that this has anything to do with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin almost broke his bamboo stick with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proof!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Good God! the man is looking for proof! Why, of
      course, the chances are twenty to one that it has nothing to do with them.
      But what else can we do? Don&rsquo;t you see we must either follow one wild
      possibility or else go home to bed?&rdquo; He banged his way into the
      restaurant, followed by his companions, and they were soon seated at a
      late luncheon at a little table, and looked at the star of smashed glass
      from the inside. Not that it was very informative to them even then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got your window broken, I see,&rdquo; said Valentin to the waiter as he paid
      the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the attendant, bending busily over the change, to
      which Valentin silently added an enormous tip. The waiter straightened
      himself with mild but unmistakable animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Very odd thing, that, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Tell us about it,&rdquo; said the detective with careless curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, two gents in black came in,&rdquo; said the waiter; &ldquo;two of those foreign
      parsons that are running about. They had a cheap and quiet little lunch,
      and one of them paid for it and went out. The other was just going out to
      join him when I looked at my change again and found he&rsquo;d paid me more than
      three times too much. &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; I says to the chap who was nearly out of the
      door, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve paid too much.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he says, very cool, &lsquo;have we?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; 
      I says, and picks up the bill to show him. Well, that was a knock-out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked his interlocutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d have sworn on seven Bibles that I&rsquo;d put 4s. on that bill. But
      now I saw I&rsquo;d put 14s., as plain as paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried Valentin, moving slowly, but with burning eyes, &ldquo;and then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parson at the door he says all serene, &lsquo;Sorry to confuse your
      accounts, but it&rsquo;ll pay for the window.&rsquo; &lsquo;What window?&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;The one
      I&rsquo;m going to break,&rsquo; he says, and smashed that blessed pane with his
      umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three inquirers made an exclamation; and the inspector said under his
      breath, &ldquo;Are we after escaped lunatics?&rdquo; The waiter went on with some
      relish for the ridiculous story:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so knocked silly for a second, I couldn&rsquo;t do anything. The man
      marched out of the place and joined his friend just round the corner. Then
      they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn&rsquo;t catch them, though I
      ran round the bars to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bullock Street,&rdquo; said the detective, and shot up that thoroughfare as
      quickly as the strange couple he pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their journey now took them through bare brick ways like tunnels; streets
      with few lights and even with few windows; streets that seemed built out
      of the blank backs of everything and everywhere. Dusk was deepening, and
      it was not easy even for the London policemen to guess in what exact
      direction they were treading. The inspector, however, was pretty certain
      that they would eventually strike some part of Hampstead Heath. Abruptly
      one bulging gas-lit window broke the blue twilight like a bull&rsquo;s-eye
      lantern; and Valentin stopped an instant before a little garish sweetstuff
      shop. After an instant&rsquo;s hesitation he went in; he stood amid the gaudy
      colours of the confectionery with entire gravity and bought thirteen
      chocolate cigars with a certain care. He was clearly preparing an opening;
      but he did not need one.
    </p>
    <p>
      An angular, elderly young woman in the shop had regarded his elegant
      appearance with a merely automatic inquiry; but when she saw the door
      behind him blocked with the blue uniform of the inspector, her eyes seemed
      to wake up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve come about that parcel, I&rsquo;ve sent it off
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parcel?&rdquo; repeated Valentin; and it was his turn to look inquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the parcel the gentleman left&mdash;the clergyman gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; said Valentin, leaning forward with his first real
      confession of eagerness, &ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake tell us what happened
      exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the woman a little doubtfully, &ldquo;the clergymen came in about
      half an hour ago and bought some peppermints and talked a bit, and then
      went off towards the Heath. But a second after, one of them runs back into
      the shop and says, &lsquo;Have I left a parcel!&rsquo; Well, I looked everywhere and
      couldn&rsquo;t see one; so he says, &lsquo;Never mind; but if it should turn up,
      please post it to this address,&rsquo; and he left me the address and a shilling
      for my trouble. And sure enough, though I thought I&rsquo;d looked everywhere, I
      found he&rsquo;d left a brown paper parcel, so I posted it to the place he said.
      I can&rsquo;t remember the address now; it was somewhere in Westminster. But as
      the thing seemed so important, I thought perhaps the police had come about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they have,&rdquo; said Valentin shortly. &ldquo;Is Hampstead Heath near here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight on for fifteen minutes,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll come right
      out on the open.&rdquo; Valentin sprang out of the shop and began to run. The
      other detectives followed him at a reluctant trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street they threaded was so narrow and shut in by shadows that when
      they came out unexpectedly into the void common and vast sky they were
      startled to find the evening still so light and clear. A perfect dome of
      peacock-green sank into gold amid the blackening trees and the dark violet
      distances. The glowing green tint was just deep enough to pick out in
      points of crystal one or two stars. All that was left of the daylight lay
      in a golden glitter across the edge of Hampstead and that popular hollow
      which is called the Vale of Health. The holiday makers who roam this
      region had not wholly dispersed; a few couples sat shapelessly on benches;
      and here and there a distant girl still shrieked in one of the swings. The
      glory of heaven deepened and darkened around the sublime vulgarity of man;
      and standing on the slope and looking across the valley, Valentin beheld
      the thing which he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the black and breaking groups in that distance was one especially
      black which did not break&mdash;a group of two figures clerically clad.
      Though they seemed as small as insects, Valentin could see that one of
      them was much smaller than the other. Though the other had a student&rsquo;s
      stoop and an inconspicuous manner, he could see that the man was well over
      six feet high. He shut his teeth and went forward, whirling his stick
      impatiently. By the time he had substantially diminished the distance and
      magnified the two black figures as in a vast microscope, he had perceived
      something else; something which startled him, and yet which he had somehow
      expected. Whoever was the tall priest, there could be no doubt about the
      identity of the short one. It was his friend of the Harwich train, the
      stumpy little cure of Essex whom he had warned about his brown paper
      parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, so far as this went, everything fitted in finally and rationally
      enough. Valentin had learned by his inquiries that morning that a Father
      Brown from Essex was bringing up a silver cross with sapphires, a relic of
      considerable value, to show some of the foreign priests at the congress.
      This undoubtedly was the &ldquo;silver with blue stones&rdquo;; and Father Brown
      undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train. Now there was nothing
      wonderful about the fact that what Valentin had found out Flambeau had
      also found out; Flambeau found out everything. Also there was nothing
      wonderful in the fact that when Flambeau heard of a sapphire cross he
      should try to steal it; that was the most natural thing in all natural
      history. And most certainly there was nothing wonderful about the fact
      that Flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly sheep as
      the man with the umbrella and the parcels. He was the sort of man whom
      anybody could lead on a string to the North Pole; it was not surprising
      that an actor like Flambeau, dressed as another priest, could lead him to
      Hampstead Heath. So far the crime seemed clear enough; and while the
      detective pitied the priest for his helplessness, he almost despised
      Flambeau for condescending to so gullible a victim. But when Valentin
      thought of all that had happened in between, of all that had led him to
      his triumph, he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or reason in it.
      What had the stealing of a blue-and-silver cross from a priest from Essex
      to do with chucking soup at wall paper? What had it to do with calling
      nuts oranges, or with paying for windows first and breaking them
      afterwards? He had come to the end of his chase; yet somehow he had missed
      the middle of it. When he failed (which was seldom), he had usually
      grasped the clue, but nevertheless missed the criminal. Here he had
      grasped the criminal, but still he could not grasp the clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two figures that they followed were crawling like black flies across
      the huge green contour of a hill. They were evidently sunk in
      conversation, and perhaps did not notice where they were going; but they
      were certainly going to the wilder and more silent heights of the Heath.
      As their pursuers gained on them, the latter had to use the undignified
      attitudes of the deer-stalker, to crouch behind clumps of trees and even
      to crawl prostrate in deep grass. By these ungainly ingenuities the
      hunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the murmur of the
      discussion, but no word could be distinguished except the word &ldquo;reason&rdquo;
       recurring frequently in a high and almost childish voice. Once over an
      abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets, the detectives actually
      lost the two figures they were following. They did not find the trail
      again for an agonising ten minutes, and then it led round the brow of a
      great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate sunset
      scenery. Under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was an old
      ramshackle wooden seat. On this seat sat the two priests still in serious
      speech together. The gorgeous green and gold still clung to the darkening
      horizon; but the dome above was turning slowly from peacock-green to
      peacock-blue, and the stars detached themselves more and more like solid
      jewels. Mutely motioning to his followers, Valentin contrived to creep up
      behind the big branching tree, and, standing there in deathly silence,
      heard the words of the strange priests for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had listened for a minute and a half, he was gripped by a
      devilish doubt. Perhaps he had dragged the two English policemen to the
      wastes of a nocturnal heath on an errand no saner than seeking figs on its
      thistles. For the two priests were talking exactly like priests, piously,
      with learning and leisure, about the most aerial enigmas of theology. The
      little Essex priest spoke the more simply, with his round face turned to
      the strengthening stars; the other talked with his head bowed, as if he
      were not even worthy to look at them. But no more innocently clerical
      conversation could have been heard in any white Italian cloister or black
      Spanish cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first he heard was the tail of one of Father Brown&rsquo;s sentences, which
      ended: &ldquo;... what they really meant in the Middle Ages by the heavens being
      incorruptible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The taller priest nodded his bowed head and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, these modern infidels appeal to their reason; but who can look
      at those millions of worlds and not feel that there may well be wonderful
      universes above us where reason is utterly unreasonable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other priest; &ldquo;reason is always reasonable, even in the
      last limbo, in the lost borderland of things. I know that people charge
      the Church with lowering reason, but it is just the other way. Alone on
      earth, the Church makes reason really supreme. Alone on earth, the Church
      affirms that God himself is bound by reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other priest raised his austere face to the spangled sky and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet who knows if in that infinite universe&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only infinite physically,&rdquo; said the little priest, turning sharply in his
      seat, &ldquo;not infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin behind his tree was tearing his fingernails with silent fury. He
      seemed almost to hear the sniggers of the English detectives whom he had
      brought so far on a fantastic guess only to listen to the metaphysical
      gossip of two mild old parsons. In his impatience he lost the equally
      elaborate answer of the tall cleric, and when he listened again it was
      again Father Brown who was speaking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star. Look at
      those stars. Don&rsquo;t they look as if they were single diamonds and
      sapphires? Well, you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please.
      Think of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants. Think the moon is a
      blue moon, a single elephantine sapphire. But don&rsquo;t fancy that all that
      frantic astronomy would make the smallest difference to the reason and
      justice of conduct. On plains of opal, under cliffs cut out of pearl, you
      would still find a notice-board, &lsquo;Thou shalt not steal.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin was just in the act of rising from his rigid and crouching
      attitude and creeping away as softly as might be, felled by the one great
      folly of his life. But something in the very silence of the tall priest
      made him stop until the latter spoke. When at last he did speak, he said
      simply, his head bowed and his hands on his knees:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think that other worlds may perhaps rise higher than our reason.
      The mystery of heaven is unfathomable, and I for one can only bow my
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with brow yet bent and without changing by the faintest shade his
      attitude or voice, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just hand over that sapphire cross of yours, will you? We&rsquo;re all alone
      here, and I could pull you to pieces like a straw doll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The utterly unaltered voice and attitude added a strange violence to that
      shocking change of speech. But the guarder of the relic only seemed to
      turn his head by the smallest section of the compass. He seemed still to
      have a somewhat foolish face turned to the stars. Perhaps he had not
      understood. Or, perhaps, he had understood and sat rigid with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the tall priest, in the same low voice and in the same still
      posture, &ldquo;yes, I am Flambeau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a pause, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, will you give me that cross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, and the monosyllable had an odd sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau suddenly flung off all his pontifical pretensions. The great
      robber leaned back in his seat and laughed low but long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t give it me, you proud prelate. You won&rsquo;t give
      it me, you little celibate simpleton. Shall I tell you why you won&rsquo;t give
      it me? Because I&rsquo;ve got it already in my own breast-pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small man from Essex turned what seemed to be a dazed face in the
      dusk, and said, with the timid eagerness of &ldquo;The Private Secretary&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are&mdash;are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau yelled with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you&rsquo;re as good as a three-act farce,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yes, you turnip,
      I am quite sure. I had the sense to make a duplicate of the right parcel,
      and now, my friend, you&rsquo;ve got the duplicate and I&rsquo;ve got the jewels. An
      old dodge, Father Brown&mdash;a very old dodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Father Brown, and passed his hand through his hair with the
      same strange vagueness of manner. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colossus of crime leaned over to the little rustic priest with a sort
      of sudden interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Where have you heard of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I mustn&rsquo;t tell you his name, of course,&rdquo; said the little man
      simply. &ldquo;He was a penitent, you know. He had lived prosperously for about
      twenty years entirely on duplicate brown paper parcels. And so, you see,
      when I began to suspect you, I thought of this poor chap&rsquo;s way of doing it
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Began to suspect me?&rdquo; repeated the outlaw with increased intensity. &ldquo;Did
      you really have the gumption to suspect me just because I brought you up
      to this bare part of the heath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Brown with an air of apology. &ldquo;You see, I suspected you
      when we first met. It&rsquo;s that little bulge up the sleeve where you people
      have the spiked bracelet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in Tartarus,&rdquo; cried Flambeau, &ldquo;did you ever hear of the spiked
      bracelet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one&rsquo;s little flock, you know!&rdquo; said Father Brown, arching his
      eyebrows rather blankly. &ldquo;When I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were
      three of them with spiked bracelets. So, as I suspected you from the
      first, don&rsquo;t you see, I made sure that the cross should go safe, anyhow.
      I&rsquo;m afraid I watched you, you know. So at last I saw you change the
      parcels. Then, don&rsquo;t you see, I changed them back again. And then I left
      the right one behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left it behind?&rdquo; repeated Flambeau, and for the first time there was
      another note in his voice beside his triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was like this,&rdquo; said the little priest, speaking in the same
      unaffected way. &ldquo;I went back to that sweet-shop and asked if I&rsquo;d left a
      parcel, and gave them a particular address if it turned up. Well, I knew I
      hadn&rsquo;t; but when I went away again I did. So, instead of running after me
      with that valuable parcel, they have sent it flying to a friend of mine in
      Westminster.&rdquo; Then he added rather sadly: &ldquo;I learnt that, too, from a poor
      fellow in Hartlepool. He used to do it with handbags he stole at railway
      stations, but he&rsquo;s in a monastery now. Oh, one gets to know, you know,&rdquo; he
      added, rubbing his head again with the same sort of desperate apology. &ldquo;We
      can&rsquo;t help being priests. People come and tell us these things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau tore a brown-paper parcel out of his inner pocket and rent it in
      pieces. There was nothing but paper and sticks of lead inside it. He
      sprang to his feet with a gigantic gesture, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you. I don&rsquo;t believe a bumpkin like you could manage all
      that. I believe you&rsquo;ve still got the stuff on you, and if you don&rsquo;t give
      it up&mdash;why, we&rsquo;re all alone, and I&rsquo;ll take it by force!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Father Brown simply, and stood up also, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t take it by
      force. First, because I really haven&rsquo;t still got it. And, second, because
      we are not alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau stopped in his stride forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behind that tree,&rdquo; said Father Brown, pointing, &ldquo;are two strong policemen
      and the greatest detective alive. How did they come here, do you ask? Why,
      I brought them, of course! How did I do it? Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you if you
      like! Lord bless you, we have to know twenty such things when we work
      among the criminal classes! Well, I wasn&rsquo;t sure you were a thief, and it
      would never do to make a scandal against one of our own clergy. So I just
      tested you to see if anything would make you show yourself. A man
      generally makes a small scene if he finds salt in his coffee; if he
      doesn&rsquo;t, he has some reason for keeping quiet. I changed the salt and
      sugar, and you kept quiet. A man generally objects if his bill is three
      times too big. If he pays it, he has some motive for passing unnoticed. I
      altered your bill, and you paid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The world seemed waiting for Flambeau to leap like a tiger. But he was
      held back as by a spell; he was stunned with the utmost curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Father Brown, with lumbering lucidity, &ldquo;as you wouldn&rsquo;t
      leave any tracks for the police, of course somebody had to. At every place
      we went to, I took care to do something that would get us talked about for
      the rest of the day. I didn&rsquo;t do much harm&mdash;a splashed wall, spilt
      apples, a broken window; but I saved the cross, as the cross will always
      be saved. It is at Westminster by now. I rather wonder you didn&rsquo;t stop it
      with the Donkey&rsquo;s Whistle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the what?&rdquo; asked Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve never heard of it,&rdquo; said the priest, making a face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a foul thing. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re too good a man for a Whistler. I couldn&rsquo;t
      have countered it even with the Spots myself; I&rsquo;m not strong enough in the
      legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you talking about?&rdquo; asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did think you&rsquo;d know the Spots,&rdquo; said Father Brown, agreeably
      surprised. &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t have gone so very wrong yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in blazes do you know all these horrors?&rdquo; cried Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow of a smile crossed the round, simple face of his clerical
      opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by being a celibate simpleton, I suppose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Has it never
      struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men&rsquo;s real sins is
      not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil? But, as a matter of fact,
      another part of my trade, too, made me sure you weren&rsquo;t a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the thief, almost gaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You attacked reason,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad theology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And even as he turned away to collect his property, the three policemen
      came out from under the twilight trees. Flambeau was an artist and a
      sportsman. He stepped back and swept Valentin a great bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not bow to me, mon ami,&rdquo; said Valentin with silver clearness. &ldquo;Let us
      both bow to our master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they both stood an instant uncovered while the little Essex priest
      blinked about for his umbrella.

    <h2>
      The Secret Garden
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aristide Valentin, Chief of the Paris Police, was late for his dinner, and
      some of his guests began to arrive before him. These were, however,
      reassured by his confidential servant, Ivan, the old man with a scar, and
      a face almost as grey as his moustaches, who always sat at a table in the
      entrance hall&mdash;a hall hung with weapons. Valentin&rsquo;s house was perhaps
      as peculiar and celebrated as its master. It was an old house, with high
      walls and tall poplars almost overhanging the Seine; but the oddity&mdash;and
      perhaps the police value&mdash;of its architecture was this: that there
      was no ultimate exit at all except through this front door, which was
      guarded by Ivan and the armoury. The garden was large and elaborate, and
      there were many exits from the house into the garden. But there was no
      exit from the garden into the world outside; all round it ran a tall,
      smooth, unscalable wall with special spikes at the top; no bad garden,
      perhaps, for a man to reflect in whom some hundred criminals had sworn to
      kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ivan explained to the guests, their host had telephoned that he was
      detained for ten minutes. He was, in truth, making some last arrangements
      about executions and such ugly things; and though these duties were
      rootedly repulsive to him, he always performed them with precision.
      Ruthless in the pursuit of criminals, he was very mild about their
      punishment. Since he had been supreme over French&mdash;and largely over
      European&mdash;policial methods, his great influence had been honourably
      used for the mitigation of sentences and the purification of prisons. He
      was one of the great humanitarian French freethinkers; and the only thing
      wrong with them is that they make mercy even colder than justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Valentin arrived he was already dressed in black clothes and the red
      rosette&mdash;an elegant figure, his dark beard already streaked with
      grey. He went straight through his house to his study, which opened on the
      grounds behind. The garden door of it was open, and after he had carefully
      locked his box in its official place, he stood for a few seconds at the
      open door looking out upon the garden. A sharp moon was fighting with the
      flying rags and tatters of a storm, and Valentin regarded it with a
      wistfulness unusual in such scientific natures as his. Perhaps such
      scientific natures have some psychic prevision of the most tremendous
      problem of their lives. From any such occult mood, at least, he quickly
      recovered, for he knew he was late, and that his guests had already begun
      to arrive. A glance at his drawing-room when he entered it was enough to
      make certain that his principal guest was not there, at any rate. He saw
      all the other pillars of the little party; he saw Lord Galloway, the
      English Ambassador&mdash;a choleric old man with a russet face like an
      apple, wearing the blue ribbon of the Garter. He saw Lady Galloway, slim
      and threadlike, with silver hair and a face sensitive and superior. He saw
      her daughter, Lady Margaret Graham, a pale and pretty girl with an elfish
      face and copper-coloured hair. He saw the Duchess of Mont St. Michel,
      black-eyed and opulent, and with her her two daughters, black-eyed and
      opulent also. He saw Dr. Simon, a typical French scientist, with glasses,
      a pointed brown beard, and a forehead barred with those parallel wrinkles
      which are the penalty of superciliousness, since they come through
      constantly elevating the eyebrows. He saw Father Brown, of Cobhole, in
      Essex, whom he had recently met in England. He saw&mdash;perhaps with more
      interest than any of these&mdash;a tall man in uniform, who had bowed to
      the Galloways without receiving any very hearty acknowledgment, and who
      now advanced alone to pay his respects to his host. This was Commandant
      O&rsquo;Brien, of the French Foreign Legion. He was a slim yet somewhat
      swaggering figure, clean-shaven, dark-haired, and blue-eyed, and, as
      seemed natural in an officer of that famous regiment of victorious
      failures and successful suicides, he had an air at once dashing and
      melancholy. He was by birth an Irish gentleman, and in boyhood had known
      the Galloways&mdash;especially Margaret Graham. He had left his country
      after some crash of debts, and now expressed his complete freedom from
      British etiquette by swinging about in uniform, sabre and spurs. When he
      bowed to the Ambassador&rsquo;s family, Lord and Lady Galloway bent stiffly, and
      Lady Margaret looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for whatever old causes such people might be interested in each other,
      their distinguished host was not specially interested in them. No one of
      them at least was in his eyes the guest of the evening. Valentin was
      expecting, for special reasons, a man of world-wide fame, whose friendship
      he had secured during some of his great detective tours and triumphs in
      the United States. He was expecting Julius K. Brayne, that
      multi-millionaire whose colossal and even crushing endowments of small
      religions have occasioned so much easy sport and easier solemnity for the
      American and English papers. Nobody could quite make out whether Mr.
      Brayne was an atheist or a Mormon or a Christian Scientist; but he was
      ready to pour money into any intellectual vessel, so long as it was an
      untried vessel. One of his hobbies was to wait for the American
      Shakespeare&mdash;a hobby more patient than angling. He admired Walt
      Whitman, but thought that Luke P. Tanner, of Paris, Pa., was more
      &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; than Whitman any day. He liked anything that he thought
      &ldquo;progressive.&rdquo; He thought Valentin &ldquo;progressive,&rdquo; thereby doing him a
      grave injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solid appearance of Julius K. Brayne in the room was as decisive as a
      dinner bell. He had this great quality, which very few of us can claim,
      that his presence was as big as his absence. He was a huge fellow, as fat
      as he was tall, clad in complete evening black, without so much relief as
      a watch-chain or a ring. His hair was white and well brushed back like a
      German&rsquo;s; his face was red, fierce and cherubic, with one dark tuft under
      the lower lip that threw up that otherwise infantile visage with an effect
      theatrical and even Mephistophelean. Not long, however, did that salon
      merely stare at the celebrated American; his lateness had already become a
      domestic problem, and he was sent with all speed into the dining-room with
      Lady Galloway on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except on one point the Galloways were genial and casual enough. So long
      as Lady Margaret did not take the arm of that adventurer O&rsquo;Brien, her
      father was quite satisfied; and she had not done so, she had decorously
      gone in with Dr. Simon. Nevertheless, old Lord Galloway was restless and
      almost rude. He was diplomatic enough during dinner, but when, over the
      cigars, three of the younger men&mdash;Simon the doctor, Brown the priest,
      and the detrimental O&rsquo;Brien, the exile in a foreign uniform&mdash;all
      melted away to mix with the ladies or smoke in the conservatory, then the
      English diplomatist grew very undiplomatic indeed. He was stung every
      sixty seconds with the thought that the scamp O&rsquo;Brien might be signalling
      to Margaret somehow; he did not attempt to imagine how. He was left over
      the coffee with Brayne, the hoary Yankee who believed in all religions,
      and Valentin, the grizzled Frenchman who believed in none. They could
      argue with each other, but neither could appeal to him. After a time this
      &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; logomachy had reached a crisis of tedium; Lord Galloway got
      up also and sought the drawing-room. He lost his way in long passages for
      some six or eight minutes: till he heard the high-pitched, didactic voice
      of the doctor, and then the dull voice of the priest, followed by general
      laughter. They also, he thought with a curse, were probably arguing about
      &ldquo;science and religion.&rdquo; But the instant he opened the salon door he saw
      only one thing&mdash;he saw what was not there. He saw that Commandant
      O&rsquo;Brien was absent, and that Lady Margaret was absent too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising impatiently from the drawing-room, as he had from the dining-room,
      he stamped along the passage once more. His notion of protecting his
      daughter from the Irish-Algerian n&rsquo;er-do-well had become something central
      and even mad in his mind. As he went towards the back of the house, where
      was Valentin&rsquo;s study, he was surprised to meet his daughter, who swept
      past with a white, scornful face, which was a second enigma. If she had
      been with O&rsquo;Brien, where was O&rsquo;Brien! If she had not been with O&rsquo;Brien,
      where had she been? With a sort of senile and passionate suspicion he
      groped his way to the dark back parts of the mansion, and eventually found
      a servants&rsquo; entrance that opened on to the garden. The moon with her
      scimitar had now ripped up and rolled away all the storm-wrack. The argent
      light lit up all four corners of the garden. A tall figure in blue was
      striding across the lawn towards the study door; a glint of moonlit silver
      on his facings picked him out as Commandant O&rsquo;Brien.
    </p>
    <p>
      He vanished through the French windows into the house, leaving Lord
      Galloway in an indescribable temper, at once virulent and vague. The
      blue-and-silver garden, like a scene in a theatre, seemed to taunt him
      with all that tyrannic tenderness against which his worldly authority was
      at war. The length and grace of the Irishman&rsquo;s stride enraged him as if he
      were a rival instead of a father; the moonlight maddened him. He was
      trapped as if by magic into a garden of troubadours, a Watteau fairyland;
      and, willing to shake off such amorous imbecilities by speech, he stepped
      briskly after his enemy. As he did so he tripped over some tree or stone
      in the grass; looked down at it first with irritation and then a second
      time with curiosity. The next instant the moon and the tall poplars looked
      at an unusual sight&mdash;an elderly English diplomatist running hard and
      crying or bellowing as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hoarse shouts brought a pale face to the study door, the beaming
      glasses and worried brow of Dr. Simon, who heard the nobleman&rsquo;s first
      clear words. Lord Galloway was crying: &ldquo;A corpse in the grass&mdash;a
      blood-stained corpse.&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien at last had gone utterly out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must tell Valentin at once,&rdquo; said the doctor, when the other had
      brokenly described all that he had dared to examine. &ldquo;It is fortunate that
      he is here;&rdquo; and even as he spoke the great detective entered the study,
      attracted by the cry. It was almost amusing to note his typical
      transformation; he had come with the common concern of a host and a
      gentleman, fearing that some guest or servant was ill. When he was told
      the gory fact, he turned with all his gravity instantly bright and
      businesslike; for this, however abrupt and awful, was his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said as they hurried out into the garden, &ldquo;that I
      should have hunted mysteries all over the earth, and now one comes and
      settles in my own back-yard. But where is the place?&rdquo; They crossed the
      lawn less easily, as a slight mist had begun to rise from the river; but
      under the guidance of the shaken Galloway they found the body sunken in
      deep grass&mdash;the body of a very tall and broad-shouldered man. He lay
      face downwards, so they could only see that his big shoulders were clad in
      black cloth, and that his big head was bald, except for a wisp or two of
      brown hair that clung to his skull like wet seaweed. A scarlet serpent of
      blood crawled from under his fallen face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Simon, with a deep and singular intonation, &ldquo;he is none
      of our party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Examine him, doctor,&rdquo; cried Valentin rather sharply. &ldquo;He may not be
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor bent down. &ldquo;He is not quite cold, but I am afraid he is dead
      enough,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Just help me to lift him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lifted him carefully an inch from the ground, and all doubts as to
      his being really dead were settled at once and frightfully. The head fell
      away. It had been entirely sundered from the body; whoever had cut his
      throat had managed to sever the neck as well. Even Valentin was slightly
      shocked. &ldquo;He must have been as strong as a gorilla,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not without a shiver, though he was used to anatomical abortions, Dr.
      Simon lifted the head. It was slightly slashed about the neck and jaw, but
      the face was substantially unhurt. It was a ponderous, yellow face, at
      once sunken and swollen, with a hawk-like nose and heavy lids&mdash;a face
      of a wicked Roman emperor, with, perhaps, a distant touch of a Chinese
      emperor. All present seemed to look at it with the coldest eye of
      ignorance. Nothing else could be noted about the man except that, as they
      had lifted his body, they had seen underneath it the white gleam of a
      shirt-front defaced with a red gleam of blood. As Dr. Simon said, the man
      had never been of their party. But he might very well have been trying to
      join it, for he had come dressed for such an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentin went down on his hands and knees and examined with his closest
      professional attention the grass and ground for some twenty yards round
      the body, in which he was assisted less skillfully by the doctor, and
      quite vaguely by the English lord. Nothing rewarded their grovellings
      except a few twigs, snapped or chopped into very small lengths, which
      Valentin lifted for an instant&rsquo;s examination and then tossed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twigs,&rdquo; he said gravely; &ldquo;twigs, and a total stranger with his head cut
      off; that is all there is on this lawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an almost creepy stillness, and then the unnerved Galloway
      called out sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that! Who&rsquo;s that over there by the garden wall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A small figure with a foolishly large head drew waveringly near them in
      the moonlit haze; looked for an instant like a goblin, but turned out to
      be the harmless little priest whom they had left in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said meekly, &ldquo;there are no gates to this garden, do you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin&rsquo;s black brows had come together somewhat crossly, as they did on
      principle at the sight of the cassock. But he was far too just a man to
      deny the relevance of the remark. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before we
      find out how he came to be killed, we may have to find out how he came to
      be here. Now listen to me, gentlemen. If it can be done without prejudice
      to my position and duty, we shall all agree that certain distinguished
      names might well be kept out of this. There are ladies, gentlemen, and
      there is a foreign ambassador. If we must mark it down as a crime, then it
      must be followed up as a crime. But till then I can use my own discretion.
      I am the head of the police; I am so public that I can afford to be
      private. Please Heaven, I will clear everyone of my own guests before I
      call in my men to look for anybody else. Gentlemen, upon your honour, you
      will none of you leave the house till tomorrow at noon; there are bedrooms
      for all. Simon, I think you know where to find my man, Ivan, in the front
      hall; he is a confidential man. Tell him to leave another servant on guard
      and come to me at once. Lord Galloway, you are certainly the best person
      to tell the ladies what has happened, and prevent a panic. They also must
      stay. Father Brown and I will remain with the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this spirit of the captain spoke in Valentin he was obeyed like a
      bugle. Dr. Simon went through to the armoury and routed out Ivan, the
      public detective&rsquo;s private detective. Galloway went to the drawing-room
      and told the terrible news tactfully enough, so that by the time the
      company assembled there the ladies were already startled and already
      soothed. Meanwhile the good priest and the good atheist stood at the head
      and foot of the dead man motionless in the moonlight, like symbolic
      statues of their two philosophies of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan, the confidential man with the scar and the moustaches, came out of
      the house like a cannon ball, and came racing across the lawn to Valentin
      like a dog to his master. His livid face was quite lively with the glow of
      this domestic detective story, and it was with almost unpleasant eagerness
      that he asked his master&rsquo;s permission to examine the remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; look, if you like, Ivan,&rdquo; said Valentin, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t be long. We must
      go in and thrash this out in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivan lifted the head, and then almost let it drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;no, it isn&rsquo;t; it can&rsquo;t be. Do you know this
      man, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Valentin indifferently; &ldquo;we had better go inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between them they carried the corpse to a sofa in the study, and then all
      made their way to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective sat down at a desk quietly, and even without hesitation; but
      his eye was the iron eye of a judge at assize. He made a few rapid notes
      upon paper in front of him, and then said shortly: &ldquo;Is everybody here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Mr. Brayne,&rdquo; said the Duchess of Mont St. Michel, looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lord Galloway in a hoarse, harsh voice. &ldquo;And not Mr. Neil
      O&rsquo;Brien, I fancy. I saw that gentleman walking in the garden when the
      corpse was still warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivan,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;go and fetch Commandant O&rsquo;Brien and Mr.
      Brayne. Mr. Brayne, I know, is finishing a cigar in the dining-room;
      Commandant O&rsquo;Brien, I think, is walking up and down the conservatory. I am
      not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faithful attendant flashed from the room, and before anyone could stir
      or speak Valentin went on with the same soldierly swiftness of exposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone here knows that a dead man has been found in the garden, his
      head cut clean from his body. Dr. Simon, you have examined it. Do you
      think that to cut a man&rsquo;s throat like that would need great force? Or,
      perhaps, only a very sharp knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say that it could not be done with a knife at all,&rdquo; said the
      pale doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any thought,&rdquo; resumed Valentin, &ldquo;of a tool with which it could
      be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking within modern probabilities, I really haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      arching his painful brows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to hack a neck through even
      clumsily, and this was a very clean cut. It could be done with a
      battle-axe or an old headsman&rsquo;s axe, or an old two-handed sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, good heavens!&rdquo; cried the Duchess, almost in hysterics, &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t
      any two-handed swords and battle-axes round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentin was still busy with the paper in front of him. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he
      said, still writing rapidly, &ldquo;could it have been done with a long French
      cavalry sabre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A low knocking came at the door, which, for some unreasonable reason,
      curdled everyone&rsquo;s blood like the knocking in Macbeth. Amid that frozen
      silence Dr. Simon managed to say: &ldquo;A sabre&mdash;yes, I suppose it could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Valentin. &ldquo;Come in, Ivan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The confidential Ivan opened the door and ushered in Commandant Neil
      O&rsquo;Brien, whom he had found at last pacing the garden again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Irish officer stood up disordered and defiant on the threshold. &ldquo;What
      do you want with me?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; said Valentin in pleasant, level tones. &ldquo;Why, you
      aren&rsquo;t wearing your sword. Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left it on the library table,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien, his brogue deepening in
      his disturbed mood. &ldquo;It was a nuisance, it was getting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivan,&rdquo; said Valentin, &ldquo;please go and get the Commandant&rsquo;s sword from the
      library.&rdquo; Then, as the servant vanished, &ldquo;Lord Galloway says he saw you
      leaving the garden just before he found the corpse. What were you doing in
      the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Commandant flung himself recklessly into a chair. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he cried in
      pure Irish, &ldquo;admirin&rsquo; the moon. Communing with Nature, me bhoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy silence sank and endured, and at the end of it came again that
      trivial and terrible knocking. Ivan reappeared, carrying an empty steel
      scabbard. &ldquo;This is all I can find,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it on the table,&rdquo; said Valentin, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an inhuman silence in the room, like that sea of inhuman silence
      round the dock of the condemned murderer. The Duchess&rsquo;s weak exclamations
      had long ago died away. Lord Galloway&rsquo;s swollen hatred was satisfied and
      even sobered. The voice that came was quite unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can tell you,&rdquo; cried Lady Margaret, in that clear, quivering
      voice with which a courageous woman speaks publicly. &ldquo;I can tell you what
      Mr. O&rsquo;Brien was doing in the garden, since he is bound to silence. He was
      asking me to marry him. I refused; I said in my family circumstances I
      could give him nothing but my respect. He was a little angry at that; he
      did not seem to think much of my respect. I wonder,&rdquo; she added, with
      rather a wan smile, &ldquo;if he will care at all for it now. For I offer it him
      now. I will swear anywhere that he never did a thing like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Galloway had edged up to his daughter, and was intimidating her in
      what he imagined to be an undertone. &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Maggie,&rdquo; he said
      in a thunderous whisper. &ldquo;Why should you shield the fellow? Where&rsquo;s his
      sword? Where&rsquo;s his confounded cavalry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped because of the singular stare with which his daughter was
      regarding him, a look that was indeed a lurid magnet for the whole group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old fool!&rdquo; she said in a low voice without pretence of piety, &ldquo;what
      do you suppose you are trying to prove? I tell you this man was innocent
      while with me. But if he wasn&rsquo;t innocent, he was still with me. If he
      murdered a man in the garden, who was it who must have seen&mdash;who must
      at least have known? Do you hate Neil so much as to put your own daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Galloway screamed. Everyone else sat tingling at the touch of those
      satanic tragedies that have been between lovers before now. They saw the
      proud, white face of the Scotch aristocrat and her lover, the Irish
      adventurer, like old portraits in a dark house. The long silence was full
      of formless historical memories of murdered husbands and poisonous
      paramours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of this morbid silence an innocent voice said: &ldquo;Was it a
      very long cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The change of thought was so sharp that they had to look round to see who
      had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said little Father Brown, from the corner of the room, &ldquo;I mean
      that cigar Mr. Brayne is finishing. It seems nearly as long as a
      walking-stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite the irrelevance there was assent as well as irritation in
      Valentin&rsquo;s face as he lifted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he remarked sharply. &ldquo;Ivan, go and see about Mr. Brayne
      again, and bring him here at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The instant the factotum had closed the door, Valentin addressed the girl
      with an entirely new earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we all feel, I am sure, both gratitude and
      admiration for your act in rising above your lower dignity and explaining
      the Commandant&rsquo;s conduct. But there is a hiatus still. Lord Galloway, I
      understand, met you passing from the study to the drawing-room, and it was
      only some minutes afterwards that he found the garden and the Commandant
      still walking there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to remember,&rdquo; replied Margaret, with a faint irony in her voice,
      &ldquo;that I had just refused him, so we should scarcely have come back arm in
      arm. He is a gentleman, anyhow; and he loitered behind&mdash;and so got
      charged with murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In those few moments,&rdquo; said Valentin gravely, &ldquo;he might really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knock came again, and Ivan put in his scarred face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but Mr. Brayne has left the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left!&rdquo; cried Valentin, and rose for the first time to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone. Scooted. Evaporated,&rdquo; replied Ivan in humorous French. &ldquo;His hat and
      coat are gone, too, and I&rsquo;ll tell you something to cap it all. I ran
      outside the house to find any traces of him, and I found one, and a big
      trace, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Valentin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said his servant, and reappeared with a flashing naked
      cavalry sabre, streaked with blood about the point and edge. Everyone in
      the room eyed it as if it were a thunderbolt; but the experienced Ivan
      went on quite quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;flung among the bushes fifty yards up the road
      to Paris. In other words, I found it just where your respectable Mr.
      Brayne threw it when he ran away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was again a silence, but of a new sort. Valentin took the sabre,
      examined it, reflected with unaffected concentration of thought, and then
      turned a respectful face to O&rsquo;Brien. &ldquo;Commandant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we trust you
      will always produce this weapon if it is wanted for police examination.
      Meanwhile,&rdquo; he added, slapping the steel back in the ringing scabbard,
      &ldquo;let me return you your sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the military symbolism of the action the audience could hardly refrain
      from applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Neil O&rsquo;Brien, indeed, that gesture was the turning-point of existence.
      By the time he was wandering in the mysterious garden again in the colours
      of the morning the tragic futility of his ordinary mien had fallen from
      him; he was a man with many reasons for happiness. Lord Galloway was a
      gentleman, and had offered him an apology. Lady Margaret was something
      better than a lady, a woman at least, and had perhaps given him something
      better than an apology, as they drifted among the old flowerbeds before
      breakfast. The whole company was more lighthearted and humane, for though
      the riddle of the death remained, the load of suspicion was lifted off
      them all, and sent flying off to Paris with the strange millionaire&mdash;a
      man they hardly knew. The devil was cast out of the house&mdash;he had
      cast himself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the riddle remained; and when O&rsquo;Brien threw himself on a garden
      seat beside Dr. Simon, that keenly scientific person at once resumed it.
      He did not get much talk out of O&rsquo;Brien, whose thoughts were on pleasanter
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it interests me much,&rdquo; said the Irishman frankly, &ldquo;especially
      as it seems pretty plain now. Apparently Brayne hated this stranger for
      some reason; lured him into the garden, and killed him with my sword. Then
      he fled to the city, tossing the sword away as he went. By the way, Ivan
      tells me the dead man had a Yankee dollar in his pocket. So he was a
      countryman of Brayne&rsquo;s, and that seems to clinch it. I don&rsquo;t see any
      difficulties about the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are five colossal difficulties,&rdquo; said the doctor quietly; &ldquo;like
      high walls within walls. Don&rsquo;t mistake me. I don&rsquo;t doubt that Brayne did
      it; his flight, I fancy, proves that. But as to how he did it. First
      difficulty: Why should a man kill another man with a great hulking sabre,
      when he can almost kill him with a pocket knife and put it back in his
      pocket? Second difficulty: Why was there no noise or outcry? Does a man
      commonly see another come up waving a scimitar and offer no remarks? Third
      difficulty: A servant watched the front door all the evening; and a rat
      cannot get into Valentin&rsquo;s garden anywhere. How did the dead man get into
      the garden? Fourth difficulty: Given the same conditions, how did Brayne
      get out of the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fifth,&rdquo; said Neil, with eyes fixed on the English priest who was
      coming slowly up the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a trifle, I suppose,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;but I think an odd one. When I
      first saw how the head had been slashed, I supposed the assassin had
      struck more than once. But on examination I found many cuts across the
      truncated section; in other words, they were struck after the head was
      off. Did Brayne hate his foe so fiendishly that he stood sabring his body
      in the moonlight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien, and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little priest, Brown, had arrived while they were talking, and had
      waited, with characteristic shyness, till they had finished. Then he said
      awkwardly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m sorry to interrupt. But I was sent to tell you the news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News?&rdquo; repeated Simon, and stared at him rather painfully through his
      glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Father Brown mildly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been another murder,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men on the seat sprang up, leaving it rocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, what&rsquo;s stranger still,&rdquo; continued the priest, with his dull eye on
      the rhododendrons, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the same disgusting sort; it&rsquo;s another beheading.
      They found the second head actually bleeding into the river, a few yards
      along Brayne&rsquo;s road to Paris; so they suppose that he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; cried O&rsquo;Brien. &ldquo;Is Brayne a monomaniac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are American vendettas,&rdquo; said the priest impassively. Then he
      added: &ldquo;They want you to come to the library and see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commandant O&rsquo;Brien followed the others towards the inquest, feeling
      decidedly sick. As a soldier, he loathed all this secretive carnage; where
      were these extravagant amputations going to stop? First one head was
      hacked off, and then another; in this case (he told himself bitterly) it
      was not true that two heads were better than one. As he crossed the study
      he almost staggered at a shocking coincidence. Upon Valentin&rsquo;s table lay
      the coloured picture of yet a third bleeding head; and it was the head of
      Valentin himself. A second glance showed him it was only a Nationalist
      paper, called The Guillotine, which every week showed one of its political
      opponents with rolling eyes and writhing features just after execution;
      for Valentin was an anti-clerical of some note. But O&rsquo;Brien was an
      Irishman, with a kind of chastity even in his sins; and his gorge rose
      against that great brutality of the intellect which belongs only to
      France. He felt Paris as a whole, from the grotesques on the Gothic
      churches to the gross caricatures in the newspapers. He remembered the
      gigantic jests of the Revolution. He saw the whole city as one ugly
      energy, from the sanguinary sketch lying on Valentin&rsquo;s table up to where,
      above a mountain and forest of gargoyles, the great devil grins on Notre
      Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library was long, low, and dark; what light entered it shot from under
      low blinds and had still some of the ruddy tinge of morning. Valentin and
      his servant Ivan were waiting for them at the upper end of a long,
      slightly-sloping desk, on which lay the mortal remains, looking enormous
      in the twilight. The big black figure and yellow face of the man found in
      the garden confronted them essentially unchanged. The second head, which
      had been fished from among the river reeds that morning, lay streaming and
      dripping beside it; Valentin&rsquo;s men were still seeking to recover the rest
      of this second corpse, which was supposed to be afloat. Father Brown, who
      did not seem to share O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s sensibilities in the least, went up to the
      second head and examined it with his blinking care. It was little more
      than a mop of wet white hair, fringed with silver fire in the red and
      level morning light; the face, which seemed of an ugly, empurpled and
      perhaps criminal type, had been much battered against trees or stones as
      it tossed in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Commandant O&rsquo;Brien,&rdquo; said Valentin, with quiet cordiality.
      &ldquo;You have heard of Brayne&rsquo;s last experiment in butchery, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown was still bending over the head with white hair, and he said,
      without looking up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is quite certain that Brayne cut off this head, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems common sense,&rdquo; said Valentin, with his hands in his
      pockets. &ldquo;Killed in the same way as the other. Found within a few yards of
      the other. And sliced by the same weapon which we know he carried away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I know,&rdquo; replied Father Brown submissively. &ldquo;Yet, you know, I
      doubt whether Brayne could have cut off this head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; inquired Dr. Simon, with a rational stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doctor,&rdquo; said the priest, looking up blinking, &ldquo;can a man cut off
      his own head? I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O&rsquo;Brien felt an insane universe crashing about his ears; but the doctor
      sprang forward with impetuous practicality and pushed back the wet white
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no doubt it&rsquo;s Brayne,&rdquo; said the priest quietly. &ldquo;He had
      exactly that chip in the left ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective, who had been regarding the priest with steady and
      glittering eyes, opened his clenched mouth and said sharply: &ldquo;You seem to
      know a lot about him, Father Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the little man simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been about with him for some
      weeks. He was thinking of joining our church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The star of the fanatic sprang into Valentin&rsquo;s eyes; he strode towards the
      priest with clenched hands. &ldquo;And, perhaps,&rdquo; he cried, with a blasting
      sneer, &ldquo;perhaps he was also thinking of leaving all his money to your
      church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he was,&rdquo; said Brown stolidly; &ldquo;it is possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; cried Valentin, with a dreadful smile, &ldquo;you may indeed
      know a great deal about him. About his life and about his&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Commandant O&rsquo;Brien laid a hand on Valentin&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Drop that slanderous
      rubbish, Valentin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or there may be more swords yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Valentin (under the steady, humble gaze of the priest) had already
      recovered himself. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said shortly, &ldquo;people&rsquo;s private opinions can
      wait. You gentlemen are still bound by your promise to stay; you must
      enforce it on yourselves&mdash;and on each other. Ivan here will tell you
      anything more you want to know; I must get to business and write to the
      authorities. We can&rsquo;t keep this quiet any longer. I shall be writing in my
      study if there is any more news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any more news, Ivan?&rdquo; asked Dr. Simon, as the chief of police
      strode out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one more thing, I think, sir,&rdquo; said Ivan, wrinkling up his grey old
      face, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s important, too, in its way. There&rsquo;s that old buffer you
      found on the lawn,&rdquo; and he pointed without pretence of reverence at the
      big black body with the yellow head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found out who he is, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried the astonished doctor, &ldquo;and who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name was Arnold Becker,&rdquo; said the under-detective, &ldquo;though he went by
      many aliases. He was a wandering sort of scamp, and is known to have been
      in America; so that was where Brayne got his knife into him. We didn&rsquo;t
      have much to do with him ourselves, for he worked mostly in Germany. We&rsquo;ve
      communicated, of course, with the German police. But, oddly enough, there
      was a twin brother of his, named Louis Becker, whom we had a great deal to
      do with. In fact, we found it necessary to guillotine him only yesterday.
      Well, it&rsquo;s a rum thing, gentlemen, but when I saw that fellow flat on the
      lawn I had the greatest jump of my life. If I hadn&rsquo;t seen Louis Becker
      guillotined with my own eyes, I&rsquo;d have sworn it was Louis Becker lying
      there in the grass. Then, of course, I remembered his twin brother in
      Germany, and following up the clue&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanatory Ivan stopped, for the excellent reason that nobody was
      listening to him. The Commandant and the doctor were both staring at
      Father Brown, who had sprung stiffly to his feet, and was holding his
      temples tight like a man in sudden and violent pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop, stop!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;stop talking a minute, for I see half. Will
      God give me strength? Will my brain make the one jump and see all? Heaven
      help me! I used to be fairly good at thinking. I could paraphrase any page
      in Aquinas once. Will my head split&mdash;or will it see? I see half&mdash;I
      only see half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He buried his head in his hands, and stood in a sort of rigid torture of
      thought or prayer, while the other three could only go on staring at this
      last prodigy of their wild twelve hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Father Brown&rsquo;s hands fell they showed a face quite fresh and serious,
      like a child&rsquo;s. He heaved a huge sigh, and said: &ldquo;Let us get this said and
      done with as quickly as possible. Look here, this will be the quickest way
      to convince you all of the truth.&rdquo; He turned to the doctor. &ldquo;Dr. Simon,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;you have a strong head-piece, and I heard you this morning
      asking the five hardest questions about this business. Well, if you will
      ask them again, I will answer them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon&rsquo;s pince-nez dropped from his nose in his doubt and wonder, but he
      answered at once. &ldquo;Well, the first question, you know, is why a man should
      kill another with a clumsy sabre at all when a man can kill with a
      bodkin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man cannot behead with a bodkin,&rdquo; said Brown calmly, &ldquo;and for this
      murder beheading was absolutely necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked O&rsquo;Brien, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the next question?&rdquo; asked Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t the man cry out or anything?&rdquo; asked the doctor; &ldquo;sabres
      in gardens are certainly unusual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twigs,&rdquo; said the priest gloomily, and turned to the window which looked
      on the scene of death. &ldquo;No one saw the point of the twigs. Why should they
      lie on that lawn (look at it) so far from any tree? They were not snapped
      off; they were chopped off. The murderer occupied his enemy with some
      tricks with the sabre, showing how he could cut a branch in mid-air, or
      what-not. Then, while his enemy bent down to see the result, a silent
      slash, and the head fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor slowly, &ldquo;that seems plausible enough. But my next
      two questions will stump anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest still stood looking critically out of the window and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how all the garden was sealed up like an air-tight chamber,&rdquo;
       went on the doctor. &ldquo;Well, how did the strange man get into the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without turning round, the little priest answered: &ldquo;There never was any
      strange man in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, and then a sudden cackle of almost childish laughter
      relieved the strain. The absurdity of Brown&rsquo;s remark moved Ivan to open
      taunts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;then we didn&rsquo;t lug a great fat corpse on to a sofa last
      night? He hadn&rsquo;t got into the garden, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got into the garden?&rdquo; repeated Brown reflectively. &ldquo;No, not entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it all,&rdquo; cried Simon, &ldquo;a man gets into a garden, or he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; said the priest, with a faint smile. &ldquo;What is the nest
      question, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you&rsquo;re ill,&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Simon sharply; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll ask the next
      question if you like. How did Brayne get out of the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t get out of the garden,&rdquo; said the priest, still looking out of
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t get out of the garden?&rdquo; exploded Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not completely,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon shook his fists in a frenzy of French logic. &ldquo;A man gets out of a
      garden, or he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Simon sprang to his feet impatiently. &ldquo;I have no time to spare on such
      senseless talk,&rdquo; he cried angrily. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t understand a man being on
      one side of a wall or the other, I won&rsquo;t trouble you further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the cleric very gently, &ldquo;we have always got on very
      pleasantly together. If only for the sake of old friendship, stop and tell
      me your fifth question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impatient Simon sank into a chair by the door and said briefly: &ldquo;The
      head and shoulders were cut about in a queer way. It seemed to be done
      after death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the motionless priest, &ldquo;it was done so as to make you assume
      exactly the one simple falsehood that you did assume. It was done to make
      you take for granted that the head belonged to the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The borderland of the brain, where all the monsters are made, moved
      horribly in the Gaelic O&rsquo;Brien. He felt the chaotic presence of all the
      horse-men and fish-women that man&rsquo;s unnatural fancy has begotten. A voice
      older than his first fathers seemed saying in his ear: &ldquo;Keep out of the
      monstrous garden where grows the tree with double fruit. Avoid the evil
      garden where died the man with two heads.&rdquo; Yet, while these shameful
      symbolic shapes passed across the ancient mirror of his Irish soul, his
      Frenchified intellect was quite alert, and was watching the odd priest as
      closely and incredulously as all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown had turned round at last, and stood against the window, with
      his face in dense shadow; but even in that shadow they could see it was
      pale as ashes. Nevertheless, he spoke quite sensibly, as if there were no
      Gaelic souls on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you did not find the strange body of Becker in the
      garden. You did not find any strange body in the garden. In face of Dr.
      Simon&rsquo;s rationalism, I still affirm that Becker was only partly present.
      Look here!&rdquo; (pointing to the black bulk of the mysterious corpse) &ldquo;you
      never saw that man in your lives. Did you ever see this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rapidly rolled away the bald, yellow head of the unknown, and put in
      its place the white-maned head beside it. And there, complete, unified,
      unmistakable, lay Julius K. Brayne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The murderer,&rdquo; went on Brown quietly, &ldquo;hacked off his enemy&rsquo;s head and
      flung the sword far over the wall. But he was too clever to fling the
      sword only. He flung the head over the wall also. Then he had only to clap
      on another head to the corpse, and (as he insisted on a private inquest)
      you all imagined a totally new man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clap on another head!&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Brien staring. &ldquo;What other head? Heads
      don&rsquo;t grow on garden bushes, do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Father Brown huskily, and looking at his boots; &ldquo;there is only
      one place where they grow. They grow in the basket of the guillotine,
      beside which the chief of police, Aristide Valentin, was standing not an
      hour before the murder. Oh, my friends, hear me a minute more before you
      tear me in pieces. Valentin is an honest man, if being mad for an arguable
      cause is honesty. But did you never see in that cold, grey eye of his that
      he is mad! He would do anything, anything, to break what he calls the
      superstition of the Cross. He has fought for it and starved for it, and
      now he has murdered for it. Brayne&rsquo;s crazy millions had hitherto been
      scattered among so many sects that they did little to alter the balance of
      things. But Valentin heard a whisper that Brayne, like so many
      scatter-brained sceptics, was drifting to us; and that was quite a
      different thing. Brayne would pour supplies into the impoverished and
      pugnacious Church of France; he would support six Nationalist newspapers
      like The Guillotine. The battle was already balanced on a point, and the
      fanatic took flame at the risk. He resolved to destroy the millionaire,
      and he did it as one would expect the greatest of detectives to commit his
      only crime. He abstracted the severed head of Becker on some
      criminological excuse, and took it home in his official box. He had that
      last argument with Brayne, that Lord Galloway did not hear the end of;
      that failing, he led him out into the sealed garden, talked about
      swordsmanship, used twigs and a sabre for illustration, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivan of the Scar sprang up. &ldquo;You lunatic,&rdquo; he yelled; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll go to my
      master now, if I take you by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I was going there,&rdquo; said Brown heavily; &ldquo;I must ask him to confess,
      and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Driving the unhappy Brown before them like a hostage or sacrifice, they
      rushed together into the sudden stillness of Valentin&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great detective sat at his desk apparently too occupied to hear their
      turbulent entrance. They paused a moment, and then something in the look
      of that upright and elegant back made the doctor run forward suddenly. A
      touch and a glance showed him that there was a small box of pills at
      Valentin&rsquo;s elbow, and that Valentin was dead in his chair; and on the
      blind face of the suicide was more than the pride of Cato.

    <h2>
      The Queer Feet
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you meet a member of that select club, &ldquo;The Twelve True Fishermen,&rdquo;
       entering the Vernon Hotel for the annual club dinner, you will observe, as
      he takes off his overcoat, that his evening coat is green and not black.
      If (supposing that you have the star-defying audacity to address such a
      being) you ask him why, he will probably answer that he does it to avoid
      being mistaken for a waiter. You will then retire crushed. But you will
      leave behind you a mystery as yet unsolved and a tale worth telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      If (to pursue the same vein of improbable conjecture) you were to meet a
      mild, hard-working little priest, named Father Brown, and were to ask him
      what he thought was the most singular luck of his life, he would probably
      reply that upon the whole his best stroke was at the Vernon Hotel, where
      he had averted a crime and, perhaps, saved a soul, merely by listening to
      a few footsteps in a passage. He is perhaps a little proud of this wild
      and wonderful guess of his, and it is possible that he might refer to it.
      But since it is immeasurably unlikely that you will ever rise high enough
      in the social world to find &ldquo;The Twelve True Fishermen,&rdquo; or that you will
      ever sink low enough among slums and criminals to find Father Brown, I
      fear you will never hear the story at all unless you hear it from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vernon Hotel at which The Twelve True Fishermen held their annual
      dinners was an institution such as can only exist in an oligarchical
      society which has almost gone mad on good manners. It was that topsy-turvy
      product&mdash;an &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; commercial enterprise. That is, it was a
      thing which paid not by attracting people, but actually by turning people
      away. In the heart of a plutocracy tradesmen become cunning enough to be
      more fastidious than their customers. They positively create difficulties
      so that their wealthy and weary clients may spend money and diplomacy in
      overcoming them. If there were a fashionable hotel in London which no man
      could enter who was under six foot, society would meekly make up parties
      of six-foot men to dine in it. If there were an expensive restaurant which
      by a mere caprice of its proprietor was only open on Thursday afternoon,
      it would be crowded on Thursday afternoon. The Vernon Hotel stood, as if
      by accident, in the corner of a square in Belgravia. It was a small hotel;
      and a very inconvenient one. But its very inconveniences were considered
      as walls protecting a particular class. One inconvenience, in particular,
      was held to be of vital importance: the fact that practically only
      twenty-four people could dine in the place at once. The only big dinner
      table was the celebrated terrace table, which stood open to the air on a
      sort of veranda overlooking one of the most exquisite old gardens in
      London. Thus it happened that even the twenty-four seats at this table
      could only be enjoyed in warm weather; and this making the enjoyment yet
      more difficult made it yet more desired. The existing owner of the hotel
      was a Jew named Lever; and he made nearly a million out of it, by making
      it difficult to get into. Of course he combined with this limitation in
      the scope of his enterprise the most careful polish in its performance.
      The wines and cooking were really as good as any in Europe, and the
      demeanour of the attendants exactly mirrored the fixed mood of the English
      upper class. The proprietor knew all his waiters like the fingers on his
      hand; there were only fifteen of them all told. It was much easier to
      become a Member of Parliament than to become a waiter in that hotel. Each
      waiter was trained in terrible silence and smoothness, as if he were a
      gentleman&rsquo;s servant. And, indeed, there was generally at least one waiter
      to every gentleman who dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The club of The Twelve True Fishermen would not have consented to dine
      anywhere but in such a place, for it insisted on a luxurious privacy; and
      would have been quite upset by the mere thought that any other club was
      even dining in the same building. On the occasion of their annual dinner
      the Fishermen were in the habit of exposing all their treasures, as if
      they were in a private house, especially the celebrated set of fish knives
      and forks which were, as it were, the insignia of the society, each being
      exquisitely wrought in silver in the form of a fish, and each loaded at
      the hilt with one large pearl. These were always laid out for the fish
      course, and the fish course was always the most magnificent in that
      magnificent repast. The society had a vast number of ceremonies and
      observances, but it had no history and no object; that was where it was so
      very aristocratic. You did not have to be anything in order to be one of
      the Twelve Fishers; unless you were already a certain sort of person, you
      never even heard of them. It had been in existence twelve years. Its
      president was Mr. Audley. Its vice-president was the Duke of Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have in any degree conveyed the atmosphere of this appalling hotel,
      the reader may feel a natural wonder as to how I came to know anything
      about it, and may even speculate as to how so ordinary a person as my
      friend Father Brown came to find himself in that golden galley. As far as
      that is concerned, my story is simple, or even vulgar. There is in the
      world a very aged rioter and demagogue who breaks into the most refined
      retreats with the dreadful information that all men are brothers, and
      wherever this leveller went on his pale horse it was Father Brown&rsquo;s trade
      to follow. One of the waiters, an Italian, had been struck down with a
      paralytic stroke that afternoon; and his Jewish employer, marvelling
      mildly at such superstitions, had consented to send for the nearest Popish
      priest. With what the waiter confessed to Father Brown we are not
      concerned, for the excellent reason that that cleric kept it to himself;
      but apparently it involved him in writing out a note or statement for the
      conveying of some message or the righting of some wrong. Father Brown,
      therefore, with a meek impudence which he would have shown equally in
      Buckingham Palace, asked to be provided with a room and writing materials.
      Mr. Lever was torn in two. He was a kind man, and had also that bad
      imitation of kindness, the dislike of any difficulty or scene. At the same
      time the presence of one unusual stranger in his hotel that evening was
      like a speck of dirt on something just cleaned. There was never any
      borderland or anteroom in the Vernon Hotel, no people waiting in the hall,
      no customers coming in on chance. There were fifteen waiters. There were
      twelve guests. It would be as startling to find a new guest in the hotel
      that night as to find a new brother taking breakfast or tea in one&rsquo;s own
      family. Moreover, the priest&rsquo;s appearance was second-rate and his clothes
      muddy; a mere glimpse of him afar off might precipitate a crisis in the
      club. Mr. Lever at last hit on a plan to cover, since he might not
      obliterate, the disgrace. When you enter (as you never will) the Vernon
      Hotel, you pass down a short passage decorated with a few dingy but
      important pictures, and come to the main vestibule and lounge which opens
      on your right into passages leading to the public rooms, and on your left
      to a similar passage pointing to the kitchens and offices of the hotel.
      Immediately on your left hand is the corner of a glass office, which abuts
      upon the lounge&mdash;a house within a house, so to speak, like the old
      hotel bar which probably once occupied its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this office sat the representative of the proprietor (nobody in this
      place ever appeared in person if he could help it), and just beyond the
      office, on the way to the servants&rsquo; quarters, was the gentlemen&rsquo;s cloak
      room, the last boundary of the gentlemen&rsquo;s domain. But between the office
      and the cloak room was a small private room without other outlet,
      sometimes used by the proprietor for delicate and important matters, such
      as lending a duke a thousand pounds or declining to lend him sixpence. It
      is a mark of the magnificent tolerance of Mr. Lever that he permitted this
      holy place to be for about half an hour profaned by a mere priest,
      scribbling away on a piece of paper. The story which Father Brown was
      writing down was very likely a much better story than this one, only it
      will never be known. I can merely state that it was very nearly as long,
      and that the last two or three paragraphs of it were the least exciting
      and absorbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it was by the time that he had reached these that the priest began a
      little to allow his thoughts to wander and his animal senses, which were
      commonly keen, to awaken. The time of darkness and dinner was drawing on;
      his own forgotten little room was without a light, and perhaps the
      gathering gloom, as occasionally happens, sharpened the sense of sound. As
      Father Brown wrote the last and least essential part of his document, he
      caught himself writing to the rhythm of a recurrent noise outside, just as
      one sometimes thinks to the tune of a railway train. When he became
      conscious of the thing he found what it was: only the ordinary patter of
      feet passing the door, which in an hotel was no very unlikely matter.
      Nevertheless, he stared at the darkened ceiling, and listened to the
      sound. After he had listened for a few seconds dreamily, he got to his
      feet and listened intently, with his head a little on one side. Then he
      sat down again and buried his brow in his hands, now not merely listening,
      but listening and thinking also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps outside at any given moment were such as one might hear in
      any hotel; and yet, taken as a whole, there was something very strange
      about them. There were no other footsteps. It was always a very silent
      house, for the few familiar guests went at once to their own apartments,
      and the well-trained waiters were told to be almost invisible until they
      were wanted. One could not conceive any place where there was less reason
      to apprehend anything irregular. But these footsteps were so odd that one
      could not decide to call them regular or irregular. Father Brown followed
      them with his finger on the edge of the table, like a man trying to learn
      a tune on the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there came a long rush of rapid little steps, such as a light man
      might make in winning a walking race. At a certain point they stopped and
      changed to a sort of slow, swinging stamp, numbering not a quarter of the
      steps, but occupying about the same time. The moment the last echoing
      stamp had died away would come again the run or ripple of light, hurrying
      feet, and then again the thud of the heavier walking. It was certainly the
      same pair of boots, partly because (as has been said) there were no other
      boots about, and partly because they had a small but unmistakable creak in
      them. Father Brown had the kind of head that cannot help asking questions;
      and on this apparently trivial question his head almost split. He had seen
      men run in order to jump. He had seen men run in order to slide. But why
      on earth should a man run in order to walk? Or, again, why should he walk
      in order to run? Yet no other description would cover the antics of this
      invisible pair of legs. The man was either walking very fast down one-half
      of the corridor in order to walk very slow down the other half; or he was
      walking very slow at one end to have the rapture of walking fast at the
      other. Neither suggestion seemed to make much sense. His brain was growing
      darker and darker, like his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as he began to think steadily, the very blackness of his cell seemed
      to make his thoughts more vivid; he began to see as in a kind of vision
      the fantastic feet capering along the corridor in unnatural or symbolic
      attitudes. Was it a heathen religious dance? Or some entirely new kind of
      scientific exercise? Father Brown began to ask himself with more exactness
      what the steps suggested. Taking the slow step first: it certainly was not
      the step of the proprietor. Men of his type walk with a rapid waddle, or
      they sit still. It could not be any servant or messenger waiting for
      directions. It did not sound like it. The poorer orders (in an oligarchy)
      sometimes lurch about when they are slightly drunk, but generally, and
      especially in such gorgeous scenes, they stand or sit in constrained
      attitudes. No; that heavy yet springy step, with a kind of careless
      emphasis, not specially noisy, yet not caring what noise it made, belonged
      to only one of the animals of this earth. It was a gentleman of western
      Europe, and probably one who had never worked for his living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he came to this solid certainty, the step changed to the quicker
      one, and ran past the door as feverishly as a rat. The listener remarked
      that though this step was much swifter it was also much more noiseless,
      almost as if the man were walking on tiptoe. Yet it was not associated in
      his mind with secrecy, but with something else&mdash;something that he
      could not remember. He was maddened by one of those half-memories that
      make a man feel half-witted. Surely he had heard that strange, swift
      walking somewhere. Suddenly he sprang to his feet with a new idea in his
      head, and walked to the door. His room had no direct outlet on the
      passage, but let on one side into the glass office, and on the other into
      the cloak room beyond. He tried the door into the office, and found it
      locked. Then he looked at the window, now a square pane full of purple
      cloud cleft by livid sunset, and for an instant he smelt evil as a dog
      smells rats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rational part of him (whether the wiser or not) regained its
      supremacy. He remembered that the proprietor had told him that he should
      lock the door, and would come later to release him. He told himself that
      twenty things he had not thought of might explain the eccentric sounds
      outside; he reminded himself that there was just enough light left to
      finish his own proper work. Bringing his paper to the window so as to
      catch the last stormy evening light, he resolutely plunged once more into
      the almost completed record. He had written for about twenty minutes,
      bending closer and closer to his paper in the lessening light; then
      suddenly he sat upright. He had heard the strange feet once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time they had a third oddity. Previously the unknown man had walked,
      with levity indeed and lightning quickness, but he had walked. This time
      he ran. One could hear the swift, soft, bounding steps coming along the
      corridor, like the pads of a fleeing and leaping panther. Whoever was
      coming was a very strong, active man, in still yet tearing excitement.
      Yet, when the sound had swept up to the office like a sort of whispering
      whirlwind, it suddenly changed again to the old slow, swaggering stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown flung down his paper, and, knowing the office door to be
      locked, went at once into the cloak room on the other side. The attendant
      of this place was temporarily absent, probably because the only guests
      were at dinner and his office was a sinecure. After groping through a grey
      forest of overcoats, he found that the dim cloak room opened on the
      lighted corridor in the form of a sort of counter or half-door, like most
      of the counters across which we have all handed umbrellas and received
      tickets. There was a light immediately above the semicircular arch of this
      opening. It threw little illumination on Father Brown himself, who seemed
      a mere dark outline against the dim sunset window behind him. But it threw
      an almost theatrical light on the man who stood outside the cloak room in
      the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an elegant man in very plain evening dress; tall, but with an air
      of not taking up much room; one felt that he could have slid along like a
      shadow where many smaller men would have been obvious and obstructive. His
      face, now flung back in the lamplight, was swarthy and vivacious, the face
      of a foreigner. His figure was good, his manners good humoured and
      confident; a critic could only say that his black coat was a shade below
      his figure and manners, and even bulged and bagged in an odd way. The
      moment he caught sight of Brown&rsquo;s black silhouette against the sunset, he
      tossed down a scrap of paper with a number and called out with amiable
      authority: &ldquo;I want my hat and coat, please; I find I have to go away at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown took the paper without a word, and obediently went to look
      for the coat; it was not the first menial work he had done in his life. He
      brought it and laid it on the counter; meanwhile, the strange gentleman
      who had been feeling in his waistcoat pocket, said laughing: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      got any silver; you can keep this.&rdquo; And he threw down half a sovereign,
      and caught up his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown&rsquo;s figure remained quite dark and still; but in that instant
      he had lost his head. His head was always most valuable when he had lost
      it. In such moments he put two and two together and made four million.
      Often the Catholic Church (which is wedded to common sense) did not
      approve of it. Often he did not approve of it himself. But it was real
      inspiration&mdash;important at rare crises&mdash;when whosoever shall lose
      his head the same shall save it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; he said civilly, &ldquo;that you have some silver in your
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall gentleman stared. &ldquo;Hang it,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if I choose to give you
      gold, why should you complain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because silver is sometimes more valuable than gold,&rdquo; said the priest
      mildly; &ldquo;that is, in large quantities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked at him curiously. Then he looked still more curiously
      up the passage towards the main entrance. Then he looked back at Brown
      again, and then he looked very carefully at the window beyond Brown&rsquo;s
      head, still coloured with the after-glow of the storm. Then he seemed to
      make up his mind. He put one hand on the counter, vaulted over as easily
      as an acrobat and towered above the priest, putting one tremendous hand
      upon his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; he said, in a hacking whisper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to threaten
      you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do want to threaten you,&rdquo; said Father Brown, in a voice like a rolling
      drum, &ldquo;I want to threaten you with the worm that dieth not, and the fire
      that is not quenched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rum sort of cloak-room clerk,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a priest, Monsieur Flambeau,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;and I am ready to hear
      your confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other stood gasping for a few moments, and then staggered back into a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two courses of the dinner of The Twelve True Fishermen had
      proceeded with placid success. I do not possess a copy of the menu; and if
      I did it would not convey anything to anybody. It was written in a sort of
      super-French employed by cooks, but quite unintelligible to Frenchmen.
      There was a tradition in the club that the hors d&rsquo;oeuvres should be
      various and manifold to the point of madness. They were taken seriously
      because they were avowedly useless extras, like the whole dinner and the
      whole club. There was also a tradition that the soup course should be
      light and unpretending&mdash;a sort of simple and austere vigil for the
      feast of fish that was to come. The talk was that strange, slight talk
      which governs the British Empire, which governs it in secret, and yet
      would scarcely enlighten an ordinary Englishman even if he could overhear
      it. Cabinet ministers on both sides were alluded to by their Christian
      names with a sort of bored benignity. The Radical Chancellor of the
      Exchequer, whom the whole Tory party was supposed to be cursing for his
      extortions, was praised for his minor poetry, or his saddle in the hunting
      field. The Tory leader, whom all Liberals were supposed to hate as a
      tyrant, was discussed and, on the whole, praised&mdash;as a Liberal. It
      seemed somehow that politicians were very important. And yet, anything
      seemed important about them except their politics. Mr. Audley, the
      chairman, was an amiable, elderly man who still wore Gladstone collars; he
      was a kind of symbol of all that phantasmal and yet fixed society. He had
      never done anything&mdash;not even anything wrong. He was not fast; he was
      not even particularly rich. He was simply in the thing; and there was an
      end of it. No party could ignore him, and if he had wished to be in the
      Cabinet he certainly would have been put there. The Duke of Chester, the
      vice-president, was a young and rising politician. That is to say, he was
      a pleasant youth, with flat, fair hair and a freckled face, with moderate
      intelligence and enormous estates. In public his appearances were always
      successful and his principle was simple enough. When he thought of a joke
      he made it, and was called brilliant. When he could not think of a joke he
      said that this was no time for trifling, and was called able. In private,
      in a club of his own class, he was simply quite pleasantly frank and
      silly, like a schoolboy. Mr. Audley, never having been in politics,
      treated them a little more seriously. Sometimes he even embarrassed the
      company by phrases suggesting that there was some difference between a
      Liberal and a Conservative. He himself was a Conservative, even in private
      life. He had a roll of grey hair over the back of his collar, like certain
      old-fashioned statesmen, and seen from behind he looked like the man the
      empire wants. Seen from the front he looked like a mild, self-indulgent
      bachelor, with rooms in the Albany&mdash;which he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been remarked, there were twenty-four seats at the terrace table,
      and only twelve members of the club. Thus they could occupy the terrace in
      the most luxurious style of all, being ranged along the inner side of the
      table, with no one opposite, commanding an uninterrupted view of the
      garden, the colours of which were still vivid, though evening was closing
      in somewhat luridly for the time of year. The chairman sat in the centre
      of the line, and the vice-president at the right-hand end of it. When the
      twelve guests first trooped into their seats it was the custom (for some
      unknown reason) for all the fifteen waiters to stand lining the wall like
      troops presenting arms to the king, while the fat proprietor stood and
      bowed to the club with radiant surprise, as if he had never heard of them
      before. But before the first chink of knife and fork this army of
      retainers had vanished, only the one or two required to collect and
      distribute the plates darting about in deathly silence. Mr. Lever, the
      proprietor, of course had disappeared in convulsions of courtesy long
      before. It would be exaggerative, indeed irreverent, to say that he ever
      positively appeared again. But when the important course, the fish course,
      was being brought on, there was&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;a vivid
      shadow, a projection of his personality, which told that he was hovering
      near. The sacred fish course consisted (to the eyes of the vulgar) in a
      sort of monstrous pudding, about the size and shape of a wedding cake, in
      which some considerable number of interesting fishes had finally lost the
      shapes which God had given to them. The Twelve True Fishermen took up
      their celebrated fish knives and fish forks, and approached it as gravely
      as if every inch of the pudding cost as much as the silver fork it was
      eaten with. So it did, for all I know. This course was dealt with in eager
      and devouring silence; and it was only when his plate was nearly empty
      that the young duke made the ritual remark: &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do this anywhere
      but here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere,&rdquo; said Mr. Audley, in a deep bass voice, turning to the speaker
      and nodding his venerable head a number of times. &ldquo;Nowhere, assuredly,
      except here. It was represented to me that at the Cafe Anglais&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he was interrupted and even agitated for a moment by the removal of
      his plate, but he recaptured the valuable thread of his thoughts. &ldquo;It was
      represented to me that the same could be done at the Cafe Anglais. Nothing
      like it, sir,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head ruthlessly, like a hanging judge.
      &ldquo;Nothing like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Overrated place,&rdquo; said a certain Colonel Pound, speaking (by the look of
      him) for the first time for some months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the Duke of Chester, who was an optimist, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      jolly good for some things. You can&rsquo;t beat it at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A waiter came swiftly along the room, and then stopped dead. His stoppage
      was as silent as his tread; but all those vague and kindly gentlemen were
      so used to the utter smoothness of the unseen machinery which surrounded
      and supported their lives, that a waiter doing anything unexpected was a
      start and a jar. They felt as you and I would feel if the inanimate world
      disobeyed&mdash;if a chair ran away from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter stood staring a few seconds, while there deepened on every face
      at table a strange shame which is wholly the product of our time. It is
      the combination of modern humanitarianism with the horrible modern abyss
      between the souls of the rich and poor. A genuine historic aristocrat
      would have thrown things at the waiter, beginning with empty bottles, and
      very probably ending with money. A genuine democrat would have asked him,
      with comrade-like clearness of speech, what the devil he was doing. But
      these modern plutocrats could not bear a poor man near to them, either as
      a slave or as a friend. That something had gone wrong with the servants
      was merely a dull, hot embarrassment. They did not want to be brutal, and
      they dreaded the need to be benevolent. They wanted the thing, whatever it
      was, to be over. It was over. The waiter, after standing for some seconds
      rigid, like a cataleptic, turned round and ran madly out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reappeared in the room, or rather in the doorway, it was in
      company with another waiter, with whom he whispered and gesticulated with
      southern fierceness. Then the first waiter went away, leaving the second
      waiter, and reappeared with a third waiter. By the time a fourth waiter
      had joined this hurried synod, Mr. Audley felt it necessary to break the
      silence in the interests of Tact. He used a very loud cough, instead of a
      presidential hammer, and said: &ldquo;Splendid work young Moocher&rsquo;s doing in
      Burmah. Now, no other nation in the world could have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fifth waiter had sped towards him like an arrow, and was whispering in
      his ear: &ldquo;So sorry. Important! Might the proprietor speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chairman turned in disorder, and with a dazed stare saw Mr. Lever
      coming towards them with his lumbering quickness. The gait of the good
      proprietor was indeed his usual gait, but his face was by no means usual.
      Generally it was a genial copper-brown; now it was a sickly yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pardon me, Mr. Audley,&rdquo; he said, with asthmatic breathlessness.
      &ldquo;I have great apprehensions. Your fish-plates, they are cleared away with
      the knife and fork on them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope so,&rdquo; said the chairman, with some warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see him?&rdquo; panted the excited hotel keeper; &ldquo;you see the waiter who
      took them away? You know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know the waiter?&rdquo; answered Mr. Audley indignantly. &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lever opened his hands with a gesture of agony. &ldquo;I never send him,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I know not when or why he come. I send my waiter to take away the
      plates, and he find them already away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Audley still looked rather too bewildered to be really the man the
      empire wants; none of the company could say anything except the man of
      wood&mdash;Colonel Pound&mdash;who seemed galvanised into an unnatural
      life. He rose rigidly from his chair, leaving all the rest sitting,
      screwed his eyeglass into his eye, and spoke in a raucous undertone as if
      he had half-forgotten how to speak. &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that somebody
      has stolen our silver fish service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor repeated the open-handed gesture with even greater
      helplessness and in a flash all the men at the table were on their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are all your waiters here?&rdquo; demanded the colonel, in his low, harsh
      accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;re all here. I noticed it myself,&rdquo; cried the young duke,
      pushing his boyish face into the inmost ring. &ldquo;Always count &lsquo;em as I come
      in; they look so queer standing up against the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely one cannot exactly remember,&rdquo; began Mr. Audley, with heavy
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember exactly, I tell you,&rdquo; cried the duke excitedly. &ldquo;There never
      have been more than fifteen waiters at this place, and there were no more
      than fifteen tonight, I&rsquo;ll swear; no more and no less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor turned upon him, quaking in a kind of palsy of surprise.
      &ldquo;You say&mdash;you say,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;that you see all my fifteen
      waiters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As usual,&rdquo; assented the duke. &ldquo;What is the matter with that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Lever, with a deepening accent, &ldquo;only you did not. For one
      of zem is dead upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a shocking stillness for an instant in that room. It may be (so
      supernatural is the word death) that each of those idle men looked for a
      second at his soul, and saw it as a small dried pea. One of them&mdash;the
      duke, I think&mdash;even said with the idiotic kindness of wealth: &ldquo;Is
      there anything we can do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has had a priest,&rdquo; said the Jew, not untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as to the clang of doom, they awoke to their own position. For a few
      weird seconds they had really felt as if the fifteenth waiter might be the
      ghost of the dead man upstairs. They had been dumb under that oppression,
      for ghosts were to them an embarrassment, like beggars. But the
      remembrance of the silver broke the spell of the miraculous; broke it
      abruptly and with a brutal reaction. The colonel flung over his chair and
      strode to the door. &ldquo;If there was a fifteenth man here, friends,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;that fifteenth fellow was a thief. Down at once to the front and back
      doors and secure everything; then we&rsquo;ll talk. The twenty-four pearls of
      the club are worth recovering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Audley seemed at first to hesitate about whether it was gentlemanly to
      be in such a hurry about anything; but, seeing the duke dash down the
      stairs with youthful energy, he followed with a more mature motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant a sixth waiter ran into the room, and declared that he
      had found the pile of fish plates on a sideboard, with no trace of the
      silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of diners and attendants that tumbled helter-skelter down the
      passages divided into two groups. Most of the Fishermen followed the
      proprietor to the front room to demand news of any exit. Colonel Pound,
      with the chairman, the vice-president, and one or two others darted down
      the corridor leading to the servants&rsquo; quarters, as the more likely line of
      escape. As they did so they passed the dim alcove or cavern of the cloak
      room, and saw a short, black-coated figure, presumably an attendant,
      standing a little way back in the shadow of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, there!&rdquo; called out the duke. &ldquo;Have you seen anyone pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The short figure did not answer the question directly, but merely said:
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have got what you are looking for, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They paused, wavering and wondering, while he quietly went to the back of
      the cloak room, and came back with both hands full of shining silver,
      which he laid out on the counter as calmly as a salesman. It took the form
      of a dozen quaintly shaped forks and knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; began the colonel, quite thrown off his balance at
      last. Then he peered into the dim little room and saw two things: first,
      that the short, black-clad man was dressed like a clergyman; and, second,
      that the window of the room behind him was burst, as if someone had passed
      violently through. &ldquo;Valuable things to deposit in a cloak room, aren&rsquo;t
      they?&rdquo; remarked the clergyman, with cheerful composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did&mdash;did you steal those things?&rdquo; stammered Mr. Audley, with staring
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did,&rdquo; said the cleric pleasantly, &ldquo;at least I am bringing them back
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Colonel Pound, still staring at the broken window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make a clean breast of it, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other, with some
      humour. And he seated himself quite gravely on a stool. &ldquo;But you know who
      did,&rdquo; said the, colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his real name,&rdquo; said the priest placidly, &ldquo;but I know
      something of his fighting weight, and a great deal about his spiritual
      difficulties. I formed the physical estimate when he was trying to
      throttle me, and the moral estimate when he repented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say&mdash;repented!&rdquo; cried young Chester, with a sort of crow of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown got to his feet, putting his hands behind him. &ldquo;Odd, isn&rsquo;t
      it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that a thief and a vagabond should repent, when so many who
      are rich and secure remain hard and frivolous, and without fruit for God
      or man? But there, if you will excuse me, you trespass a little upon my
      province. If you doubt the penitence as a practical fact, there are your
      knives and forks. You are The Twelve True Fishers, and there are all your
      silver fish. But He has made me a fisher of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you catch this man?&rdquo; asked the colonel, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown looked him full in his frowning face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      caught him, with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough
      to let him wander to the ends of the world, and still to bring him back
      with a twitch upon the thread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. All the other men present drifted away to carry
      the recovered silver to their comrades, or to consult the proprietor about
      the queer condition of affairs. But the grim-faced colonel still sat
      sideways on the counter, swinging his long, lank legs and biting his dark
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he said quietly to the priest: &ldquo;He must have been a clever fellow,
      but I think I know a cleverer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a clever fellow,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;but I am not quite sure of
      what other you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean you,&rdquo; said the colonel, with a short laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get
      the fellow jailed; make yourself easy about that. But I&rsquo;d give a good many
      silver forks to know exactly how you fell into this affair, and how you
      got the stuff out of him. I reckon you&rsquo;re the most up-to-date devil of the
      present company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown seemed rather to like the saturnine candour of the soldier.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t tell you anything of the man&rsquo;s
      identity, or his own story, of course; but there&rsquo;s no particular reason
      why I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you of the mere outside facts which I found out for
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hopped over the barrier with unexpected activity, and sat beside
      Colonel Pound, kicking his short legs like a little boy on a gate. He
      began to tell the story as easily as if he were telling it to an old
      friend by a Christmas fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, colonel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was shut up in that small room there doing
      some writing, when I heard a pair of feet in this passage doing a dance
      that was as queer as the dance of death. First came quick, funny little
      steps, like a man walking on tiptoe for a wager; then came slow, careless,
      creaking steps, as of a big man walking about with a cigar. But they were
      both made by the same feet, I swear, and they came in rotation; first the
      run and then the walk, and then the run again. I wondered at first idly
      and then wildly why a man should act these two parts at once. One walk I
      knew; it was just like yours, colonel. It was the walk of a well-fed
      gentleman waiting for something, who strolls about rather because he is
      physically alert than because he is mentally impatient. I knew that I knew
      the other walk, too, but I could not remember what it was. What wild
      creature had I met on my travels that tore along on tiptoe in that
      extraordinary style? Then I heard a clink of plates somewhere; and the
      answer stood up as plain as St. Peter&rsquo;s. It was the walk of a waiter&mdash;that
      walk with the body slanted forward, the eyes looking down, the ball of the
      toe spurning away the ground, the coat tails and napkin flying. Then I
      thought for a minute and a half more. And I believe I saw the manner of
      the crime, as clearly as if I were going to commit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Pound looked at him keenly, but the speaker&rsquo;s mild grey eyes were
      fixed upon the ceiling with almost empty wistfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crime,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;is like any other work of art. Don&rsquo;t look
      surprised; crimes are by no means the only works of art that come from an
      infernal workshop. But every work of art, divine or diabolic, has one
      indispensable mark&mdash;I mean, that the centre of it is simple, however
      much the fulfilment may be complicated. Thus, in Hamlet, let us say, the
      grotesqueness of the grave-digger, the flowers of the mad girl, the
      fantastic finery of Osric, the pallor of the ghost and the grin of the
      skull are all oddities in a sort of tangled wreath round one plain tragic
      figure of a man in black. Well, this also,&rdquo; he said, getting slowly down
      from his seat with a smile, &ldquo;this also is the plain tragedy of a man in
      black. Yes,&rdquo; he went on, seeing the colonel look up in some wonder, &ldquo;the
      whole of this tale turns on a black coat. In this, as in Hamlet, there are
      the rococo excrescences&mdash;yourselves, let us say. There is the dead
      waiter, who was there when he could not be there. There is the invisible
      hand that swept your table clear of silver and melted into air. But every
      clever crime is founded ultimately on some one quite simple fact&mdash;some
      fact that is not itself mysterious. The mystification comes in covering it
      up, in leading men&rsquo;s thoughts away from it. This large and subtle and (in
      the ordinary course) most profitable crime, was built on the plain fact
      that a gentleman&rsquo;s evening dress is the same as a waiter&rsquo;s. All the rest
      was acting, and thundering good acting, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the colonel, getting up and frowning at his boots, &ldquo;I am not
      sure that I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;I tell you that this archangel of impudence
      who stole your forks walked up and down this passage twenty times in the
      blaze of all the lamps, in the glare of all the eyes. He did not go and
      hide in dim corners where suspicion might have searched for him. He kept
      constantly on the move in the lighted corridors, and everywhere that he
      went he seemed to be there by right. Don&rsquo;t ask me what he was like; you
      have seen him yourself six or seven times tonight. You were waiting with
      all the other grand people in the reception room at the end of the passage
      there, with the terrace just beyond. Whenever he came among you gentlemen,
      he came in the lightning style of a waiter, with bent head, flapping
      napkin and flying feet. He shot out on to the terrace, did something to
      the table cloth, and shot back again towards the office and the waiters&rsquo; 
      quarters. By the time he had come under the eye of the office clerk and
      the waiters he had become another man in every inch of his body, in every
      instinctive gesture. He strolled among the servants with the absent-minded
      insolence which they have all seen in their patrons. It was no new thing
      to them that a swell from the dinner party should pace all parts of the
      house like an animal at the Zoo; they know that nothing marks the Smart
      Set more than a habit of walking where one chooses. When he was
      magnificently weary of walking down that particular passage he would wheel
      round and pace back past the office; in the shadow of the arch just beyond
      he was altered as by a blast of magic, and went hurrying forward again
      among the Twelve Fishermen, an obsequious attendant. Why should the
      gentlemen look at a chance waiter? Why should the waiters suspect a
      first-rate walking gentleman? Once or twice he played the coolest tricks.
      In the proprietor&rsquo;s private quarters he called out breezily for a syphon
      of soda water, saying he was thirsty. He said genially that he would carry
      it himself, and he did; he carried it quickly and correctly through the
      thick of you, a waiter with an obvious errand. Of course, it could not
      have been kept up long, but it only had to be kept up till the end of the
      fish course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His worst moment was when the waiters stood in a row; but even then he
      contrived to lean against the wall just round the corner in such a way
      that for that important instant the waiters thought him a gentleman, while
      the gentlemen thought him a waiter. The rest went like winking. If any
      waiter caught him away from the table, that waiter caught a languid
      aristocrat. He had only to time himself two minutes before the fish was
      cleared, become a swift servant, and clear it himself. He put the plates
      down on a sideboard, stuffed the silver in his breast pocket, giving it a
      bulgy look, and ran like a hare (I heard him coming) till he came to the
      cloak room. There he had only to be a plutocrat again&mdash;a plutocrat
      called away suddenly on business. He had only to give his ticket to the
      cloak-room attendant, and go out again elegantly as he had come in. Only&mdash;only
      I happened to be the cloak-room attendant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do to him?&rdquo; cried the colonel, with unusual intensity. &ldquo;What
      did he tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the priest immovably, &ldquo;that is where the story
      ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the interesting story begins,&rdquo; muttered Pound. &ldquo;I think I understand
      his professional trick. But I don&rsquo;t seem to have got hold of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be going,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together along the passage to the entrance hall, where they
      saw the fresh, freckled face of the Duke of Chester, who was bounding
      buoyantly along towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Pound,&rdquo; he cried breathlessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you
      everywhere. The dinner&rsquo;s going again in spanking style, and old Audley has
      got to make a speech in honour of the forks being saved. We want to start
      some new ceremony, don&rsquo;t you know, to commemorate the occasion. I say, you
      really got the goods back, what do you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the colonel, eyeing him with a certain sardonic approval, &ldquo;I
      should suggest that henceforward we wear green coats, instead of black.
      One never knows what mistakes may arise when one looks so like a waiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it all!&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;a gentleman never looks like a
      waiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor a waiter like a gentleman, I suppose,&rdquo; said Colonel Pound, with the
      same lowering laughter on his face. &ldquo;Reverend sir, your friend must have
      been very smart to act the gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown buttoned up his commonplace overcoat to the neck, for the
      night was stormy, and took his commonplace umbrella from the stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it must be very hard work to be a gentleman; but, do you
      know, I have sometimes thought that it may be almost as laborious to be a
      waiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And saying &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; he pushed open the heavy doors of that palace
      of pleasures. The golden gates closed behind him, and he went at a brisk
      walk through the damp, dark streets in search of a penny omnibus.

    <h2>
      The Flying Stars
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most beautiful crime I ever committed,&rdquo; Flambeau would say in his
      highly moral old age, &ldquo;was also, by a singular coincidence, my last. It
      was committed at Christmas. As an artist I had always attempted to provide
      crimes suitable to the special season or landscapes in which I found
      myself, choosing this or that terrace or garden for a catastrophe, as if
      for a statuary group. Thus squires should be swindled in long rooms
      panelled with oak; while Jews, on the other hand, should rather find
      themselves unexpectedly penniless among the lights and screens of the Cafe
      Riche. Thus, in England, if I wished to relieve a dean of his riches
      (which is not so easy as you might suppose), I wished to frame him, if I
      make myself clear, in the green lawns and grey towers of some cathedral
      town. Similarly, in France, when I had got money out of a rich and wicked
      peasant (which is almost impossible), it gratified me to get his indignant
      head relieved against a grey line of clipped poplars, and those solemn
      plains of Gaul over which broods the mighty spirit of Millet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my last crime was a Christmas crime, a cheery, cosy, English
      middle-class crime; a crime of Charles Dickens. I did it in a good old
      middle-class house near Putney, a house with a crescent of carriage drive,
      a house with a stable by the side of it, a house with the name on the two
      outer gates, a house with a monkey tree. Enough, you know the species. I
      really think my imitation of Dickens&rsquo;s style was dexterous and literary.
      It seems almost a pity I repented the same evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau would then proceed to tell the story from the inside; and even
      from the inside it was odd. Seen from the outside it was perfectly
      incomprehensible, and it is from the outside that the stranger must study
      it. From this standpoint the drama may be said to have begun when the
      front doors of the house with the stable opened on the garden with the
      monkey tree, and a young girl came out with bread to feed the birds on the
      afternoon of Boxing Day. She had a pretty face, with brave brown eyes; but
      her figure was beyond conjecture, for she was so wrapped up in brown furs
      that it was hard to say which was hair and which was fur. But for the
      attractive face she might have been a small toddling bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter afternoon was reddening towards evening, and already a ruby
      light was rolled over the bloomless beds, filling them, as it were, with
      the ghosts of the dead roses. On one side of the house stood the stable,
      on the other an alley or cloister of laurels led to the larger garden
      behind. The young lady, having scattered bread for the birds (for the
      fourth or fifth time that day, because the dog ate it), passed
      unobtrusively down the lane of laurels and into a glimmering plantation of
      evergreens behind. Here she gave an exclamation of wonder, real or ritual,
      and looking up at the high garden wall above her, beheld it fantastically
      bestridden by a somewhat fantastic figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t jump, Mr. Crook,&rdquo; she called out in some alarm; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s much too
      high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The individual riding the party wall like an aerial horse was a tall,
      angular young man, with dark hair sticking up like a hair brush,
      intelligent and even distinguished lineaments, but a sallow and almost
      alien complexion. This showed the more plainly because he wore an
      aggressive red tie, the only part of his costume of which he seemed to
      take any care. Perhaps it was a symbol. He took no notice of the girl&rsquo;s
      alarmed adjuration, but leapt like a grasshopper to the ground beside her,
      where he might very well have broken his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I was meant to be a burglar,&rdquo; he said placidly, &ldquo;and I have no
      doubt I should have been if I hadn&rsquo;t happened to be born in that nice
      house next door. I can&rsquo;t see any harm in it, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say such things!&rdquo; she remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re born on the wrong side of the wall,
      I can&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s wrong to climb over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never know what you will say or do next,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often know myself,&rdquo; replied Mr. Crook; &ldquo;but then I am on the
      right side of the wall now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which is the right side of the wall?&rdquo; asked the young lady, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whichever side you are on,&rdquo; said the young man named Crook.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went together through the laurels towards the front garden a motor
      horn sounded thrice, coming nearer and nearer, and a car of splendid
      speed, great elegance, and a pale green colour swept up to the front doors
      like a bird and stood throbbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, hullo!&rdquo; said the young man with the red tie, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s somebody born
      on the right side, anyhow. I didn&rsquo;t know, Miss Adams, that your Santa
      Claus was so modern as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my godfather, Sir Leopold Fischer. He always comes on Boxing
      Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after an innocent pause, which unconsciously betrayed some lack of
      enthusiasm, Ruby Adams added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Crook, journalist, had heard of that eminent City magnate; and it was
      not his fault if the City magnate had not heard of him; for in certain
      articles in The Clarion or The New Age Sir Leopold had been dealt with
      austerely. But he said nothing and grimly watched the unloading of the
      motor-car, which was rather a long process. A large, neat chauffeur in
      green got out from the front, and a small, neat manservant in grey got out
      from the back, and between them they deposited Sir Leopold on the doorstep
      and began to unpack him, like some very carefully protected parcel. Rugs
      enough to stock a bazaar, furs of all the beasts of the forest, and
      scarves of all the colours of the rainbow were unwrapped one by one, till
      they revealed something resembling the human form; the form of a friendly,
      but foreign-looking old gentleman, with a grey goat-like beard and a
      beaming smile, who rubbed his big fur gloves together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before this revelation was complete the two big doors of the porch
      had opened in the middle, and Colonel Adams (father of the furry young
      lady) had come out himself to invite his eminent guest inside. He was a
      tall, sunburnt, and very silent man, who wore a red smoking-cap like a
      fez, making him look like one of the English Sirdars or Pashas in Egypt.
      With him was his brother-in-law, lately come from Canada, a big and rather
      boisterous young gentleman-farmer, with a yellow beard, by name James
      Blount. With him also was the more insignificant figure of the priest from
      the neighbouring Roman Church; for the colonel&rsquo;s late wife had been a
      Catholic, and the children, as is common in such cases, had been trained
      to follow her. Everything seemed undistinguished about the priest, even
      down to his name, which was Brown; yet the colonel had always found
      something companionable about him, and frequently asked him to such family
      gatherings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the large entrance hall of the house there was ample room even for Sir
      Leopold and the removal of his wraps. Porch and vestibule, indeed, were
      unduly large in proportion to the house, and formed, as it were, a big
      room with the front door at one end, and the bottom of the staircase at
      the other. In front of the large hall fire, over which hung the colonel&rsquo;s
      sword, the process was completed and the company, including the saturnine
      Crook, presented to Sir Leopold Fischer. That venerable financier,
      however, still seemed struggling with portions of his well-lined attire,
      and at length produced from a very interior tail-coat pocket, a black oval
      case which he radiantly explained to be his Christmas present for his
      god-daughter. With an unaffected vain-glory that had something disarming
      about it he held out the case before them all; it flew open at a touch and
      half-blinded them. It was just as if a crystal fountain had spurted in
      their eyes. In a nest of orange velvet lay like three eggs, three white
      and vivid diamonds that seemed to set the very air on fire all round them.
      Fischer stood beaming benevolently and drinking deep of the astonishment
      and ecstasy of the girl, the grim admiration and gruff thanks of the
      colonel, the wonder of the whole group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put &lsquo;em back now, my dear,&rdquo; said Fischer, returning the case to the
      tails of his coat. &ldquo;I had to be careful of &lsquo;em coming down. They&rsquo;re the
      three great African diamonds called &lsquo;The Flying Stars,&rsquo; because they&rsquo;ve
      been stolen so often. All the big criminals are on the track; but even the
      rough men about in the streets and hotels could hardly have kept their
      hands off them. I might have lost them on the road here. It was quite
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite natural, I should say,&rdquo; growled the man in the red tie. &ldquo;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t blame &lsquo;em if they had taken &lsquo;em. When they ask for bread, and
      you don&rsquo;t even give them a stone, I think they might take the stone for
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you talking like that,&rdquo; cried the girl, who was in a curious
      glow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only talked like that since you became a horrid
      what&rsquo;s-his-name. You know what I mean. What do you call a man who wants to
      embrace the chimney-sweep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A saint,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Sir Leopold, with a supercilious smile, &ldquo;that Ruby means a
      Socialist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A radical does not mean a man who lives on radishes,&rdquo; remarked Crook,
      with some impatience; &ldquo;and a Conservative does not mean a man who
      preserves jam. Neither, I assure you, does a Socialist mean a man who
      desires a social evening with the chimney-sweep. A Socialist means a man
      who wants all the chimneys swept and all the chimney-sweeps paid for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who won&rsquo;t allow you,&rdquo; put in the priest in a low voice, &ldquo;to own your
      own soot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crook looked at him with an eye of interest and even respect. &ldquo;Does one
      want to own soot?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might,&rdquo; answered Brown, with speculation in his eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that
      gardeners use it. And I once made six children happy at Christmas when the
      conjuror didn&rsquo;t come, entirely with soot&mdash;applied externally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, splendid,&rdquo; cried Ruby. &ldquo;Oh, I wish you&rsquo;d do it to this company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boisterous Canadian, Mr. Blount, was lifting his loud voice in
      applause, and the astonished financier his (in some considerable
      deprecation), when a knock sounded at the double front doors. The priest
      opened them, and they showed again the front garden of evergreens,
      monkey-tree and all, now gathering gloom against a gorgeous violet sunset.
      The scene thus framed was so coloured and quaint, like a back scene in a
      play, that they forgot a moment the insignificant figure standing in the
      door. He was dusty-looking and in a frayed coat, evidently a common
      messenger. &ldquo;Any of you gentlemen Mr. Blount?&rdquo; he asked, and held forward a
      letter doubtfully. Mr. Blount started, and stopped in his shout of assent.
      Ripping up the envelope with evident astonishment he read it; his face
      clouded a little, and then cleared, and he turned to his brother-in-law
      and host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick at being such a nuisance, colonel,&rdquo; he said, with the cheery
      colonial conventions; &ldquo;but would it upset you if an old acquaintance
      called on me here tonight on business? In point of fact it&rsquo;s Florian, that
      famous French acrobat and comic actor; I knew him years ago out West (he
      was a French-Canadian by birth), and he seems to have business for me,
      though I hardly guess what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; replied the colonel carelessly&mdash;&ldquo;My dear
      chap, any friend of yours. No doubt he will prove an acquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll black his face, if that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; cried Blount, laughing.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt he&rsquo;d black everyone else&rsquo;s eyes. I don&rsquo;t care; I&rsquo;m not
      refined. I like the jolly old pantomime where a man sits on his top hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on mine, please,&rdquo; said Sir Leopold Fischer, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; observed Crook, airily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel. There are
      lower jokes than sitting on a top hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dislike of the red-tied youth, born of his predatory opinions and evident
      intimacy with the pretty godchild, led Fischer to say, in his most
      sarcastic, magisterial manner: &ldquo;No doubt you have found something much
      lower than sitting on a top hat. What is it, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letting a top hat sit on you, for instance,&rdquo; said the Socialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now, now,&rdquo; cried the Canadian farmer with his barbarian benevolence,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s spoil a jolly evening. What I say is, let&rsquo;s do something for
      the company tonight. Not blacking faces or sitting on hats, if you don&rsquo;t
      like those&mdash;but something of the sort. Why couldn&rsquo;t we have a proper
      old English pantomime&mdash;clown, columbine, and so on. I saw one when I
      left England at twelve years old, and it&rsquo;s blazed in my brain like a
      bonfire ever since. I came back to the old country only last year, and I
      find the thing&rsquo;s extinct. Nothing but a lot of snivelling fairy plays. I
      want a hot poker and a policeman made into sausages, and they give me
      princesses moralising by moonlight, Blue Birds, or something. Blue Beard&rsquo;s
      more in my line, and him I like best when he turned into the pantaloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for making a policeman into sausages,&rdquo; said John Crook. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      better definition of Socialism than some recently given. But surely the
      get-up would be too big a business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a scrap,&rdquo; cried Blount, quite carried away. &ldquo;A harlequinade&rsquo;s the
      quickest thing we can do, for two reasons. First, one can gag to any
      degree; and, second, all the objects are household things&mdash;tables and
      towel-horses and washing baskets, and things like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; admitted Crook, nodding eagerly and walking about. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
      afraid I can&rsquo;t have my policeman&rsquo;s uniform? Haven&rsquo;t killed a policeman
      lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blount frowned thoughtfully a space, and then smote his thigh. &ldquo;Yes, we
      can!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Florian&rsquo;s address here, and he knows every
      costumier in London. I&rsquo;ll phone him to bring a police dress when he
      comes.&rdquo; And he went bounding away to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s glorious, godfather,&rdquo; cried Ruby, almost dancing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
      columbine and you shall be pantaloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The millionaire held himself stiff with a sort of heathen solemnity. &ldquo;I
      think, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must get someone else for pantaloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be pantaloon, if you like,&rdquo; said Colonel Adams, taking his cigar
      out of his mouth, and speaking for the first and last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have a statue,&rdquo; cried the Canadian, as he came back,
      radiant, from the telephone. &ldquo;There, we are all fitted. Mr. Crook shall be
      clown; he&rsquo;s a journalist and knows all the oldest jokes. I can be
      harlequin, that only wants long legs and jumping about. My friend Florian
      &lsquo;phones he&rsquo;s bringing the police costume; he&rsquo;s changing on the way. We can
      act it in this very hall, the audience sitting on those broad stairs
      opposite, one row above another. These front doors can be the back scene,
      either open or shut. Shut, you see an English interior. Open, a moonlit
      garden. It all goes by magic.&rdquo; And snatching a chance piece of billiard
      chalk from his pocket, he ran it across the hall floor, half-way between
      the front door and the staircase, to mark the line of the footlights.
    </p>
    <p>
      How even such a banquet of bosh was got ready in the time remained a
      riddle. But they went at it with that mixture of recklessness and industry
      that lives when youth is in a house; and youth was in that house that
      night, though not all may have isolated the two faces and hearts from
      which it flamed. As always happens, the invention grew wilder and wilder
      through the very tameness of the bourgeois conventions from which it had
      to create. The columbine looked charming in an outstanding skirt that
      strangely resembled the large lamp-shade in the drawing-room. The clown
      and pantaloon made themselves white with flour from the cook, and red with
      rouge from some other domestic, who remained (like all true Christian
      benefactors) anonymous. The harlequin, already clad in silver paper out of
      cigar boxes, was, with difficulty, prevented from smashing the old
      Victorian lustre chandeliers, that he might cover himself with resplendent
      crystals. In fact he would certainly have done so, had not Ruby unearthed
      some old pantomime paste jewels she had worn at a fancy dress party as the
      Queen of Diamonds. Indeed, her uncle, James Blount, was getting almost out
      of hand in his excitement; he was like a schoolboy. He put a paper
      donkey&rsquo;s head unexpectedly on Father Brown, who bore it patiently, and
      even found some private manner of moving his ears. He even essayed to put
      the paper donkey&rsquo;s tail to the coat-tails of Sir Leopold Fischer. This,
      however, was frowned down. &ldquo;Uncle is too absurd,&rdquo; cried Ruby to Crook,
      round whose shoulders she had seriously placed a string of sausages. &ldquo;Why
      is he so wild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is harlequin to your columbine,&rdquo; said Crook. &ldquo;I am only the clown who
      makes the old jokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were the harlequin,&rdquo; she said, and left the string of sausages
      swinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown, though he knew every detail done behind the scenes, and had
      even evoked applause by his transformation of a pillow into a pantomime
      baby, went round to the front and sat among the audience with all the
      solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee. The spectators were
      few, relations, one or two local friends, and the servants; Sir Leopold
      sat in the front seat, his full and still fur-collared figure largely
      obscuring the view of the little cleric behind him; but it has never been
      settled by artistic authorities whether the cleric lost much. The
      pantomime was utterly chaotic, yet not contemptible; there ran through it
      a rage of improvisation which came chiefly from Crook the clown. Commonly
      he was a clever man, and he was inspired tonight with a wild omniscience,
      a folly wiser than the world, that which comes to a young man who has seen
      for an instant a particular expression on a particular face. He was
      supposed to be the clown, but he was really almost everything else, the
      author (so far as there was an author), the prompter, the scene-painter,
      the scene-shifter, and, above all, the orchestra. At abrupt intervals in
      the outrageous performance he would hurl himself in full costume at the
      piano and bang out some popular music equally absurd and appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The climax of this, as of all else, was the moment when the two front
      doors at the back of the scene flew open, showing the lovely moonlit
      garden, but showing more prominently the famous professional guest; the
      great Florian, dressed up as a policeman. The clown at the piano played
      the constabulary chorus in the &ldquo;Pirates of Penzance,&rdquo; but it was drowned
      in the deafening applause, for every gesture of the great comic actor was
      an admirable though restrained version of the carriage and manner of the
      police. The harlequin leapt upon him and hit him over the helmet; the
      pianist playing &ldquo;Where did you get that hat?&rdquo; he faced about in admirably
      simulated astonishment, and then the leaping harlequin hit him again (the
      pianist suggesting a few bars of &ldquo;Then we had another one&rdquo;). Then the
      harlequin rushed right into the arms of the policeman and fell on top of
      him, amid a roar of applause. Then it was that the strange actor gave that
      celebrated imitation of a dead man, of which the fame still lingers round
      Putney. It was almost impossible to believe that a living person could
      appear so limp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The athletic harlequin swung him about like a sack or twisted or tossed
      him like an Indian club; all the time to the most maddeningly ludicrous
      tunes from the piano. When the harlequin heaved the comic constable
      heavily off the floor the clown played &ldquo;I arise from dreams of thee.&rdquo; When
      he shuffled him across his back, &ldquo;With my bundle on my shoulder,&rdquo; and when
      the harlequin finally let fall the policeman with a most convincing thud,
      the lunatic at the instrument struck into a jingling measure with some
      words which are still believed to have been, &ldquo;I sent a letter to my love
      and on the way I dropped it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At about this limit of mental anarchy Father Brown&rsquo;s view was obscured
      altogether; for the City magnate in front of him rose to his full height
      and thrust his hands savagely into all his pockets. Then he sat down
      nervously, still fumbling, and then stood up again. For an instant it
      seemed seriously likely that he would stride across the footlights; then
      he turned a glare at the clown playing the piano; and then he burst in
      silence out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest had only watched for a few more minutes the absurd but not
      inelegant dance of the amateur harlequin over his splendidly unconscious
      foe. With real though rude art, the harlequin danced slowly backwards out
      of the door into the garden, which was full of moonlight and stillness.
      The vamped dress of silver paper and paste, which had been too glaring in
      the footlights, looked more and more magical and silvery as it danced away
      under a brilliant moon. The audience was closing in with a cataract of
      applause, when Brown felt his arm abruptly touched, and he was asked in a
      whisper to come into the colonel&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed his summoner with increasing doubt, which was not dispelled by
      a solemn comicality in the scene of the study. There sat Colonel Adams,
      still unaffectedly dressed as a pantaloon, with the knobbed whalebone
      nodding above his brow, but with his poor old eyes sad enough to have
      sobered a Saturnalia. Sir Leopold Fischer was leaning against the
      mantelpiece and heaving with all the importance of panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very painful matter, Father Brown,&rdquo; said Adams. &ldquo;The truth is,
      those diamonds we all saw this afternoon seem to have vanished from my
      friend&rsquo;s tail-coat pocket. And as you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I,&rdquo; supplemented Father Brown, with a broad grin, &ldquo;was sitting just
      behind him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort shall be suggested,&rdquo; said Colonel Adams, with a firm
      look at Fischer, which rather implied that some such thing had been
      suggested. &ldquo;I only ask you to give me the assistance that any gentleman
      might give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is turning out his pockets,&rdquo; said Father Brown, and proceeded to do
      so, displaying seven and sixpence, a return ticket, a small silver
      crucifix, a small breviary, and a stick of chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel looked at him long, and then said, &ldquo;Do you know, I should like
      to see the inside of your head more than the inside of your pockets. My
      daughter is one of your people, I know; well, she has lately&mdash;&rdquo; and
      he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has lately,&rdquo; cried out old Fischer, &ldquo;opened her father&rsquo;s house to a
      cut-throat Socialist, who says openly he would steal anything from a
      richer man. This is the end of it. Here is the richer man&mdash;and none
      the richer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want the inside of my head you can have it,&rdquo; said Brown rather
      wearily. &ldquo;What it&rsquo;s worth you can say afterwards. But the first thing I
      find in that disused pocket is this: that men who mean to steal diamonds
      don&rsquo;t talk Socialism. They are more likely,&rdquo; he added demurely, &ldquo;to
      denounce it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the others shifted sharply and the priest went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we know these people, more or less. That Socialist would no more
      steal a diamond than a Pyramid. We ought to look at once to the one man we
      don&rsquo;t know. The fellow acting the policeman&mdash;Florian. Where is he
      exactly at this minute, I wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pantaloon sprang erect and strode out of the room. An interlude
      ensued, during which the millionaire stared at the priest, and the priest
      at his breviary; then the pantaloon returned and said, with staccato
      gravity, &ldquo;The policeman is still lying on the stage. The curtain has gone
      up and down six times; he is still lying there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown dropped his book and stood staring with a look of blank
      mental ruin. Very slowly a light began to creep in his grey eyes, and then
      he made the scarcely obvious answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please forgive me, colonel, but when did your wife die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife!&rdquo; replied the staring soldier, &ldquo;she died this year two months. Her
      brother James arrived just a week too late to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little priest bounded like a rabbit shot. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he cried in quite
      unusual excitement. &ldquo;Come on! We&rsquo;ve got to go and look at that policeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rushed on to the now curtained stage, breaking rudely past the
      columbine and clown (who seemed whispering quite contentedly), and Father
      Brown bent over the prostrate comic policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chloroform,&rdquo; he said as he rose; &ldquo;I only guessed it just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a startled stillness, and then the colonel said slowly, &ldquo;Please
      say seriously what all this means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown suddenly shouted with laughter, then stopped, and only
      struggled with it for instants during the rest of his speech. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
       he gasped, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not much time to talk. I must run after the criminal.
      But this great French actor who played the policeman&mdash;this clever
      corpse the harlequin waltzed with and dandled and threw about&mdash;he was&mdash;&rdquo;
       His voice again failed him, and he turned his back to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was?&rdquo; called Fischer inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A real policeman,&rdquo; said Father Brown, and ran away into the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were hollows and bowers at the extreme end of that leafy garden, in
      which the laurels and other immortal shrubs showed against sapphire sky
      and silver moon, even in that midwinter, warm colours as of the south. The
      green gaiety of the waving laurels, the rich purple indigo of the night,
      the moon like a monstrous crystal, make an almost irresponsible romantic
      picture; and among the top branches of the garden trees a strange figure
      is climbing, who looks not so much romantic as impossible. He sparkles
      from head to heel, as if clad in ten million moons; the real moon catches
      him at every movement and sets a new inch of him on fire. But he swings,
      flashing and successful, from the short tree in this garden to the tall,
      rambling tree in the other, and only stops there because a shade has slid
      under the smaller tree and has unmistakably called up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Flambeau,&rdquo; says the voice, &ldquo;you really look like a Flying Star; but
      that always means a Falling Star at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silver, sparkling figure above seems to lean forward in the laurels
      and, confident of escape, listens to the little figure below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never did anything better, Flambeau. It was clever to come from
      Canada (with a Paris ticket, I suppose) just a week after Mrs. Adams died,
      when no one was in a mood to ask questions. It was cleverer to have marked
      down the Flying Stars and the very day of Fischer&rsquo;s coming. But there&rsquo;s no
      cleverness, but mere genius, in what followed. Stealing the stones, I
      suppose, was nothing to you. You could have done it by sleight of hand in
      a hundred other ways besides that pretence of putting a paper donkey&rsquo;s
      tail to Fischer&rsquo;s coat. But in the rest you eclipsed yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silvery figure among the green leaves seems to linger as if
      hypnotised, though his escape is easy behind him; he is staring at the man
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; says the man below, &ldquo;I know all about it. I know you not only
      forced the pantomime, but put it to a double use. You were going to steal
      the stones quietly; news came by an accomplice that you were already
      suspected, and a capable police officer was coming to rout you up that
      very night. A common thief would have been thankful for the warning and
      fled; but you are a poet. You already had the clever notion of hiding the
      jewels in a blaze of false stage jewellery. Now, you saw that if the dress
      were a harlequin&rsquo;s the appearance of a policeman would be quite in
      keeping. The worthy officer started from Putney police station to find
      you, and walked into the queerest trap ever set in this world. When the
      front door opened he walked straight on to the stage of a Christmas
      pantomime, where he could be kicked, clubbed, stunned and drugged by the
      dancing harlequin, amid roars of laughter from all the most respectable
      people in Putney. Oh, you will never do anything better. And now, by the
      way, you might give me back those diamonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The green branch on which the glittering figure swung, rustled as if in
      astonishment; but the voice went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to give them back, Flambeau, and I want you to give up this
      life. There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don&rsquo;t fancy they
      will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man
      has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and
      down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies
      about it. Many a man I&rsquo;ve known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a
      merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime. Maurice Blum
      started out as an anarchist of principle, a father of the poor; he ended a
      greasy spy and tale-bearer that both sides used and despised. Harry Burke
      started his free money movement sincerely enough; now he&rsquo;s sponging on a
      half-starved sister for endless brandies and sodas. Lord Amber went into
      wild society in a sort of chivalry; now he&rsquo;s paying blackmail to the
      lowest vultures in London. Captain Barillon was the great gentleman-apache
      before your time; he died in a madhouse, screaming with fear of the
      &ldquo;narks&rdquo; and receivers that had betrayed him and hunted him down. I know
      the woods look very free behind you, Flambeau; I know that in a flash you
      could melt into them like a monkey. But some day you will be an old grey
      monkey, Flambeau. You will sit up in your free forest cold at heart and
      close to death, and the tree-tops will be very bare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everything continued still, as if the small man below held the other in
      the tree in some long invisible leash; and he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your downward steps have begun. You used to boast of doing nothing mean,
      but you are doing something mean tonight. You are leaving suspicion on an
      honest boy with a good deal against him already; you are separating him
      from the woman he loves and who loves him. But you will do meaner things
      than that before you die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three flashing diamonds fell from the tree to the turf. The small man
      stooped to pick them up, and when he looked up again the green cage of the
      tree was emptied of its silver bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restoration of the gems (accidentally picked up by Father Brown, of
      all people) ended the evening in uproarious triumph; and Sir Leopold, in
      his height of good humour, even told the priest that though he himself had
      broader views, he could respect those whose creed required them to be
      cloistered and ignorant of this world.

    <h2>
      The Invisible Man
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the cool blue twilight of two steep streets in Camden Town, the shop at
      the corner, a confectioner&rsquo;s, glowed like the butt of a cigar. One should
      rather say, perhaps, like the butt of a firework, for the light was of
      many colours and some complexity, broken up by many mirrors and dancing on
      many gilt and gaily-coloured cakes and sweetmeats. Against this one fiery
      glass were glued the noses of many gutter-snipes, for the chocolates were
      all wrapped in those red and gold and green metallic colours which are
      almost better than chocolate itself; and the huge white wedding-cake in
      the window was somehow at once remote and satisfying, just as if the whole
      North Pole were good to eat. Such rainbow provocations could naturally
      collect the youth of the neighbourhood up to the ages of ten or twelve.
      But this corner was also attractive to youth at a later stage; and a young
      man, not less than twenty-four, was staring into the same shop window. To
      him, also, the shop was of fiery charm, but this attraction was not wholly
      to be explained by chocolates; which, however, he was far from despising.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall, burly, red-haired young man, with a resolute face but a
      listless manner. He carried under his arm a flat, grey portfolio of
      black-and-white sketches, which he had sold with more or less success to
      publishers ever since his uncle (who was an admiral) had disinherited him
      for Socialism, because of a lecture which he had delivered against that
      economic theory. His name was John Turnbull Angus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering at last, he walked through the confectioner&rsquo;s shop to the back
      room, which was a sort of pastry-cook restaurant, merely raising his hat
      to the young lady who was serving there. She was a dark, elegant, alert
      girl in black, with a high colour and very quick, dark eyes; and after the
      ordinary interval she followed him into the inner room to take his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      His order was evidently a usual one. &ldquo;I want, please,&rdquo; he said with
      precision, &ldquo;one halfpenny bun and a small cup of black coffee.&rdquo; An instant
      before the girl could turn away he added, &ldquo;Also, I want you to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady of the shop stiffened suddenly and said, &ldquo;Those are jokes I
      don&rsquo;t allow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red-haired young man lifted grey eyes of an unexpected gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really and truly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as serious&mdash;as serious as the
      halfpenny bun. It is expensive, like the bun; one pays for it. It is
      indigestible, like the bun. It hurts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark young lady had never taken her dark eyes off him, but seemed to
      be studying him with almost tragic exactitude. At the end of her scrutiny
      she had something like the shadow of a smile, and she sat down in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; observed Angus, absently, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s rather cruel to
      eat these halfpenny buns? They might grow up into penny buns. I shall give
      up these brutal sports when we are married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark young lady rose from her chair and walked to the window,
      evidently in a state of strong but not unsympathetic cogitation. When at
      last she swung round again with an air of resolution she was bewildered to
      observe that the young man was carefully laying out on the table various
      objects from the shop-window. They included a pyramid of highly coloured
      sweets, several plates of sandwiches, and the two decanters containing
      that mysterious port and sherry which are peculiar to pastry-cooks. In the
      middle of this neat arrangement he had carefully let down the enormous
      load of white sugared cake which had been the huge ornament of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you doing?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duty, my dear Laura,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, stop a minute,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t talk to me
      in that way. I mean, what is all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ceremonial meal, Miss Hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; she asked impatiently, pointing to the mountain of
      sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wedding-cake, Mrs. Angus,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl marched to that article, removed it with some clatter, and put it
      back in the shop window; she then returned, and, putting her elegant
      elbows on the table, regarded the young man not unfavourably but with
      considerable exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give me any time to think,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not such a fool,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my Christian humility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still looking at him; but she had grown considerably graver behind
      the smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Angus,&rdquo; she said steadily, &ldquo;before there is a minute more of this
      nonsense I must tell you something about myself as shortly as I can.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; replied Angus gravely. &ldquo;You might tell me something about
      myself, too, while you are about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do hold your tongue and listen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing that I&rsquo;m
      ashamed of, and it isn&rsquo;t even anything that I&rsquo;m specially sorry about. But
      what would you say if there were something that is no business of mine and
      yet is my nightmare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the man seriously, &ldquo;I should suggest that you bring
      back the cake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must listen to the story first,&rdquo; said Laura, persistently. &ldquo;To
      begin with, I must tell you that my father owned the inn called the &lsquo;Red
      Fish&rsquo; at Ludbury, and I used to serve people in the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often wondered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why there was a kind of a Christian air
      about this one confectioner&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ludbury is a sleepy, grassy little hole in the Eastern Counties, and the
      only kind of people who ever came to the &lsquo;Red Fish&rsquo; were occasional
      commercial travellers, and for the rest, the most awful people you can
      see, only you&rsquo;ve never seen them. I mean little, loungy men, who had just
      enough to live on and had nothing to do but lean about in bar-rooms and
      bet on horses, in bad clothes that were just too good for them. Even these
      wretched young rotters were not very common at our house; but there were
      two of them that were a lot too common&mdash;common in every sort of way.
      They both lived on money of their own, and were wearisomely idle and
      over-dressed. But yet I was a bit sorry for them, because I half believe
      they slunk into our little empty bar because each of them had a slight
      deformity; the sort of thing that some yokels laugh at. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly
      a deformity either; it was more an oddity. One of them was a surprisingly
      small man, something like a dwarf, or at least like a jockey. He was not
      at all jockeyish to look at, though; he had a round black head and a
      well-trimmed black beard, bright eyes like a bird&rsquo;s; he jingled money in
      his pockets; he jangled a great gold watch chain; and he never turned up
      except dressed just too much like a gentleman to be one. He was no fool
      though, though a futile idler; he was curiously clever at all kinds of
      things that couldn&rsquo;t be the slightest use; a sort of impromptu conjuring;
      making fifteen matches set fire to each other like a regular firework; or
      cutting a banana or some such thing into a dancing doll. His name was
      Isidore Smythe; and I can see him still, with his little dark face, just
      coming up to the counter, making a jumping kangaroo out of five cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other fellow was more silent and more ordinary; but somehow he
      alarmed me much more than poor little Smythe. He was very tall and slight,
      and light-haired; his nose had a high bridge, and he might almost have
      been handsome in a spectral sort of way; but he had one of the most
      appalling squints I have ever seen or heard of. When he looked straight at
      you, you didn&rsquo;t know where you were yourself, let alone what he was
      looking at. I fancy this sort of disfigurement embittered the poor chap a
      little; for while Smythe was ready to show off his monkey tricks anywhere,
      James Welkin (that was the squinting man&rsquo;s name) never did anything except
      soak in our bar parlour, and go for great walks by himself in the flat,
      grey country all round. All the same, I think Smythe, too, was a little
      sensitive about being so small, though he carried it off more smartly. And
      so it was that I was really puzzled, as well as startled, and very sorry,
      when they both offered to marry me in the same week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did what I&rsquo;ve since thought was perhaps a silly thing. But, after
      all, these freaks were my friends in a way; and I had a horror of their
      thinking I refused them for the real reason, which was that they were so
      impossibly ugly. So I made up some gas of another sort, about never
      meaning to marry anyone who hadn&rsquo;t carved his way in the world. I said it
      was a point of principle with me not to live on money that was just
      inherited like theirs. Two days after I had talked in this well-meaning
      sort of way, the whole trouble began. The first thing I heard was that
      both of them had gone off to seek their fortunes, as if they were in some
      silly fairy tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never seen either of them from that day to this. But I&rsquo;ve had
      two letters from the little man called Smythe, and really they were rather
      exciting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever heard of the other man?&rdquo; asked Angus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he never wrote,&rdquo; said the girl, after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation.
      &ldquo;Smythe&rsquo;s first letter was simply to say that he had started out walking
      with Welkin to London; but Welkin was such a good walker that the little
      man dropped out of it, and took a rest by the roadside. He happened to be
      picked up by some travelling show, and, partly because he was nearly a
      dwarf, and partly because he was really a clever little wretch, he got on
      quite well in the show business, and was soon sent up to the Aquarium, to
      do some tricks that I forget. That was his first letter. His second was
      much more of a startler, and I only got it last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man called Angus emptied his coffee-cup and regarded her with mild and
      patient eyes. Her own mouth took a slight twist of laughter as she
      resumed, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve seen on the hoardings all about this &lsquo;Smythe&rsquo;s
      Silent Service&rsquo;? Or you must be the only person that hasn&rsquo;t. Oh, I don&rsquo;t
      know much about it, it&rsquo;s some clockwork invention for doing all the
      housework by machinery. You know the sort of thing: &lsquo;Press a Button&mdash;A
      Butler who Never Drinks.&rsquo; &lsquo;Turn a Handle&mdash;Ten Housemaids who Never
      Flirt.&rsquo; You must have seen the advertisements. Well, whatever these
      machines are, they are making pots of money; and they are making it all
      for that little imp whom I knew down in Ludbury. I can&rsquo;t help feeling
      pleased the poor little chap has fallen on his feet; but the plain fact
      is, I&rsquo;m in terror of his turning up any minute and telling me he&rsquo;s carved
      his way in the world&mdash;as he certainly has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other man?&rdquo; repeated Angus with a sort of obstinate quietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura Hope got to her feet suddenly. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think you
      are a witch. Yes, you are quite right. I have not seen a line of the other
      man&rsquo;s writing; and I have no more notion than the dead of what or where he
      is. But it is of him that I am frightened. It is he who is all about my
      path. It is he who has half driven me mad. Indeed, I think he has driven
      me mad; for I have felt him where he could not have been, and I have heard
      his voice when he could not have spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said the young man, cheerfully, &ldquo;if he were Satan
      himself, he is done for now you have told somebody. One goes mad all
      alone, old girl. But when was it you fancied you felt and heard our
      squinting friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard James Welkin laugh as plainly as I hear you speak,&rdquo; said the
      girl, steadily. &ldquo;There was nobody there, for I stood just outside the shop
      at the corner, and could see down both streets at once. I had forgotten
      how he laughed, though his laugh was as odd as his squint. I had not
      thought of him for nearly a year. But it&rsquo;s a solemn truth that a few
      seconds later the first letter came from his rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever make the spectre speak or squeak, or anything?&rdquo; asked Angus,
      with some interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura suddenly shuddered, and then said, with an unshaken voice, &ldquo;Yes.
      Just when I had finished reading the second letter from Isidore Smythe
      announcing his success. Just then, I heard Welkin say, &lsquo;He shan&rsquo;t have
      you, though.&rsquo; It was quite plain, as if he were in the room. It is awful,
      I think I must be mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really were mad,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;you would think you must be
      sane. But certainly there seems to me to be something a little rum about
      this unseen gentleman. Two heads are better than one&mdash;I spare you
      allusions to any other organs and really, if you would allow me, as a
      sturdy, practical man, to bring back the wedding-cake out of the window&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke, there was a sort of steely shriek in the street outside,
      and a small motor, driven at devilish speed, shot up to the door of the
      shop and stuck there. In the same flash of time a small man in a shiny top
      hat stood stamping in the outer room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angus, who had hitherto maintained hilarious ease from motives of mental
      hygiene, revealed the strain of his soul by striding abruptly out of the
      inner room and confronting the new-comer. A glance at him was quite
      sufficient to confirm the savage guesswork of a man in love. This very
      dapper but dwarfish figure, with the spike of black beard carried
      insolently forward, the clever unrestful eyes, the neat but very nervous
      fingers, could be none other than the man just described to him: Isidore
      Smythe, who made dolls out of banana skins and match-boxes; Isidore
      Smythe, who made millions out of undrinking butlers and unflirting
      housemaids of metal. For a moment the two men, instinctively understanding
      each other&rsquo;s air of possession, looked at each other with that curious
      cold generosity which is the soul of rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smythe, however, made no allusion to the ultimate ground of their
      antagonism, but said simply and explosively, &ldquo;Has Miss Hope seen that
      thing on the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the window?&rdquo; repeated the staring Angus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to explain other things,&rdquo; said the small millionaire
      shortly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some tomfoolery going on here that has to be
      investigated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed his polished walking-stick at the window, recently depleted by
      the bridal preparations of Mr. Angus; and that gentleman was astonished to
      see along the front of the glass a long strip of paper pasted, which had
      certainly not been on the window when he looked through it some time
      before. Following the energetic Smythe outside into the street, he found
      that some yard and a half of stamp paper had been carefully gummed along
      the glass outside, and on this was written in straggly characters, &ldquo;If you
      marry Smythe, he will die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; said Angus, putting his big red head into the shop, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not
      mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the writing of that fellow Welkin,&rdquo; said Smythe gruffly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      seen him for years, but he&rsquo;s always bothering me. Five times in the last
      fortnight he&rsquo;s had threatening letters left at my flat, and I can&rsquo;t even
      find out who leaves them, let alone if it is Welkin himself. The porter of
      the flats swears that no suspicious characters have been seen, and here he
      has pasted up a sort of dado on a public shop window, while the people in
      the shop&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Angus modestly, &ldquo;while the people in the shop were having
      tea. Well, sir, I can assure you I appreciate your common sense in dealing
      so directly with the matter. We can talk about other things afterwards.
      The fellow cannot be very far off yet, for I swear there was no paper
      there when I went last to the window, ten or fifteen minutes ago. On the
      other hand, he&rsquo;s too far off to be chased, as we don&rsquo;t even know the
      direction. If you&rsquo;ll take my advice, Mr. Smythe, you&rsquo;ll put this at once
      in the hands of some energetic inquiry man, private rather than public. I
      know an extremely clever fellow, who has set up in business five minutes
      from here in your car. His name&rsquo;s Flambeau, and though his youth was a bit
      stormy, he&rsquo;s a strictly honest man now, and his brains are worth money. He
      lives in Lucknow Mansions, Hampstead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is odd,&rdquo; said the little man, arching his black eyebrows. &ldquo;I live,
      myself, in Himylaya Mansions, round the corner. Perhaps you might care to
      come with me; I can go to my rooms and sort out these queer Welkin
      documents, while you run round and get your friend the detective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said Angus politely. &ldquo;Well, the sooner we act the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both men, with a queer kind of impromptu fairness, took the same sort of
      formal farewell of the lady, and both jumped into the brisk little car. As
      Smythe took the handles and they turned the great corner of the street,
      Angus was amused to see a gigantesque poster of &ldquo;Smythe&rsquo;s Silent Service,&rdquo;
       with a picture of a huge headless iron doll, carrying a saucepan with the
      legend, &ldquo;A Cook Who is Never Cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I use them in my own flat,&rdquo; said the little black-bearded man, laughing,
      &ldquo;partly for advertisements, and partly for real convenience. Honestly, and
      all above board, those big clockwork dolls of mine do bring your coals or
      claret or a timetable quicker than any live servants I&rsquo;ve ever known, if
      you know which knob to press. But I&rsquo;ll never deny, between ourselves, that
      such servants have their disadvantages, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Angus; &ldquo;is there something they can&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Smythe coolly; &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t tell me who left those
      threatening letters at my flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s motor was small and swift like himself; in fact, like his
      domestic service, it was of his own invention. If he was an advertising
      quack, he was one who believed in his own wares. The sense of something
      tiny and flying was accentuated as they swept up long white curves of road
      in the dead but open daylight of evening. Soon the white curves came
      sharper and dizzier; they were upon ascending spirals, as they say in the
      modern religions. For, indeed, they were cresting a corner of London which
      is almost as precipitous as Edinburgh, if not quite so picturesque.
      Terrace rose above terrace, and the special tower of flats they sought,
      rose above them all to almost Egyptian height, gilt by the level sunset.
      The change, as they turned the corner and entered the crescent known as
      Himylaya Mansions, was as abrupt as the opening of a window; for they
      found that pile of flats sitting above London as above a green sea of
      slate. Opposite to the mansions, on the other side of the gravel crescent,
      was a bushy enclosure more like a steep hedge or dyke than a garden, and
      some way below that ran a strip of artificial water, a sort of canal, like
      the moat of that embowered fortress. As the car swept round the crescent
      it passed, at one corner, the stray stall of a man selling chestnuts; and
      right away at the other end of the curve, Angus could see a dim blue
      policeman walking slowly. These were the only human shapes in that high
      suburban solitude; but he had an irrational sense that they expressed the
      speechless poetry of London. He felt as if they were figures in a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little car shot up to the right house like a bullet, and shot out its
      owner like a bomb shell. He was immediately inquiring of a tall
      commissionaire in shining braid, and a short porter in shirt sleeves,
      whether anybody or anything had been seeking his apartments. He was
      assured that nobody and nothing had passed these officials since his last
      inquiries; whereupon he and the slightly bewildered Angus were shot up in
      the lift like a rocket, till they reached the top floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come in for a minute,&rdquo; said the breathless Smythe. &ldquo;I want to show
      you those Welkin letters. Then you might run round the corner and fetch
      your friend.&rdquo; He pressed a button concealed in the wall, and the door
      opened of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It opened on a long, commodious ante-room, of which the only arresting
      features, ordinarily speaking, were the rows of tall half-human mechanical
      figures that stood up on both sides like tailors&rsquo; dummies. Like tailors&rsquo; 
      dummies they were headless; and like tailors&rsquo; dummies they had a handsome
      unnecessary humpiness in the shoulders, and a pigeon-breasted protuberance
      of chest; but barring this, they were not much more like a human figure
      than any automatic machine at a station that is about the human height.
      They had two great hooks like arms, for carrying trays; and they were
      painted pea-green, or vermilion, or black for convenience of distinction;
      in every other way they were only automatic machines and nobody would have
      looked twice at them. On this occasion, at least, nobody did. For between
      the two rows of these domestic dummies lay something more interesting than
      most of the mechanics of the world. It was a white, tattered scrap of
      paper scrawled with red ink; and the agile inventor had snatched it up
      almost as soon as the door flew open. He handed it to Angus without a
      word. The red ink on it actually was not dry, and the message ran, &ldquo;If you
      have been to see her today, I shall kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, and then Isidore Smythe said quietly, &ldquo;Would
      you like a little whiskey? I rather feel as if I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I should like a little Flambeau,&rdquo; said Angus, gloomily. &ldquo;This
      business seems to me to be getting rather grave. I&rsquo;m going round at once
      to fetch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said the other, with admirable cheerfulness. &ldquo;Bring him
      round here as quick as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as Angus closed the front door behind him he saw Smythe push back a
      button, and one of the clockwork images glided from its place and slid
      along a groove in the floor carrying a tray with syphon and decanter.
      There did seem something a trifle weird about leaving the little man alone
      among those dead servants, who were coming to life as the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six steps down from Smythe&rsquo;s landing the man in shirt sleeves was doing
      something with a pail. Angus stopped to extract a promise, fortified with
      a prospective bribe, that he would remain in that place until the return
      with the detective, and would keep count of any kind of stranger coming up
      those stairs. Dashing down to the front hall he then laid similar charges
      of vigilance on the commissionaire at the front door, from whom he learned
      the simplifying circumstances that there was no back door. Not content
      with this, he captured the floating policeman and induced him to stand
      opposite the entrance and watch it; and finally paused an instant for a
      pennyworth of chestnuts, and an inquiry as to the probable length of the
      merchant&rsquo;s stay in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chestnut seller, turning up the collar of his coat, told him he should
      probably be moving shortly, as he thought it was going to snow. Indeed,
      the evening was growing grey and bitter, but Angus, with all his
      eloquence, proceeded to nail the chestnut man to his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep yourself warm on your own chestnuts,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;Eat up
      your whole stock; I&rsquo;ll make it worth your while. I&rsquo;ll give you a sovereign
      if you&rsquo;ll wait here till I come back, and then tell me whether any man,
      woman, or child has gone into that house where the commissionaire is
      standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then walked away smartly, with a last look at the besieged tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a ring round that room, anyhow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t all four
      of them be Mr. Welkin&rsquo;s accomplices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucknow Mansions were, so to speak, on a lower platform of that hill of
      houses, of which Himylaya Mansions might be called the peak. Mr.
      Flambeau&rsquo;s semi-official flat was on the ground floor, and presented in
      every way a marked contrast to the American machinery and cold hotel-like
      luxury of the flat of the Silent Service. Flambeau, who was a friend of
      Angus, received him in a rococo artistic den behind his office, of which
      the ornaments were sabres, harquebuses, Eastern curiosities, flasks of
      Italian wine, savage cooking-pots, a plumy Persian cat, and a small
      dusty-looking Roman Catholic priest, who looked particularly out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my friend Father Brown,&rdquo; said Flambeau. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wanted you to
      meet him. Splendid weather, this; a little cold for Southerners like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it will keep clear,&rdquo; said Angus, sitting down on a
      violet-striped Eastern ottoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the priest quietly, &ldquo;it has begun to snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, as he spoke, the first few flakes, foreseen by the man of
      chestnuts, began to drift across the darkening windowpane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Angus heavily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve come on business, and rather
      jumpy business at that. The fact is, Flambeau, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of
      your house is a fellow who badly wants your help; he&rsquo;s perpetually being
      haunted and threatened by an invisible enemy&mdash;a scoundrel whom nobody
      has even seen.&rdquo; As Angus proceeded to tell the whole tale of Smythe and
      Welkin, beginning with Laura&rsquo;s story, and going on with his own, the
      supernatural laugh at the corner of two empty streets, the strange
      distinct words spoken in an empty room, Flambeau grew more and more
      vividly concerned, and the little priest seemed to be left out of it, like
      a piece of furniture. When it came to the scribbled stamp-paper pasted on
      the window, Flambeau rose, seeming to fill the room with his huge
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think you had better tell me the rest on
      the nearest road to this man&rsquo;s house. It strikes me, somehow, that there
      is no time to be lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said Angus, rising also, &ldquo;though he&rsquo;s safe enough for the
      present, for I&rsquo;ve set four men to watch the only hole to his burrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned out into the street, the small priest trundling after them
      with the docility of a small dog. He merely said, in a cheerful way, like
      one making conversation, &ldquo;How quick the snow gets thick on the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they threaded the steep side streets already powdered with silver,
      Angus finished his story; and by the time they reached the crescent with
      the towering flats, he had leisure to turn his attention to the four
      sentinels. The chestnut seller, both before and after receiving a
      sovereign, swore stubbornly that he had watched the door and seen no
      visitor enter. The policeman was even more emphatic. He said he had had
      experience of crooks of all kinds, in top hats and in rags; he wasn&rsquo;t so
      green as to expect suspicious characters to look suspicious; he looked out
      for anybody, and, so help him, there had been nobody. And when all three
      men gathered round the gilded commissionaire, who still stood smiling
      astride of the porch, the verdict was more final still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a right to ask any man, duke or dustman, what he wants in these
      flats,&rdquo; said the genial and gold-laced giant, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll swear there&rsquo;s been
      nobody to ask since this gentleman went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unimportant Father Brown, who stood back, looking modestly at the
      pavement, here ventured to say meekly, &ldquo;Has nobody been up and down
      stairs, then, since the snow began to fall? It began while we were all
      round at Flambeau&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s been in here, sir, you can take it from me,&rdquo; said the official,
      with beaming authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I wonder what that is?&rdquo; said the priest, and stared at the ground
      blankly like a fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others all looked down also; and Flambeau used a fierce exclamation
      and a French gesture. For it was unquestionably true that down the middle
      of the entrance guarded by the man in gold lace, actually between the
      arrogant, stretched legs of that colossus, ran a stringy pattern of grey
      footprints stamped upon the white snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; cried Angus involuntarily, &ldquo;the Invisible Man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without another word he turned and dashed up the stairs, with Flambeau
      following; but Father Brown still stood looking about him in the snow-clad
      street as if he had lost interest in his query.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau was plainly in a mood to break down the door with his big
      shoulders; but the Scotchman, with more reason, if less intuition, fumbled
      about on the frame of the door till he found the invisible button; and the
      door swung slowly open.
    </p>
    <p>
      It showed substantially the same serried interior; the hall had grown
      darker, though it was still struck here and there with the last crimson
      shafts of sunset, and one or two of the headless machines had been moved
      from their places for this or that purpose, and stood here and there about
      the twilit place. The green and red of their coats were all darkened in
      the dusk; and their likeness to human shapes slightly increased by their
      very shapelessness. But in the middle of them all, exactly where the paper
      with the red ink had lain, there lay something that looked like red ink
      spilt out of its bottle. But it was not red ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a French combination of reason and violence Flambeau simply said
      &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; and, plunging into the flat, had explored, every corner and
      cupboard of it in five minutes. But if he expected to find a corpse he
      found none. Isidore Smythe was not in the place, either dead or alive.
      After the most tearing search the two men met each other in the outer
      hall, with streaming faces and staring eyes. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Flambeau,
      talking French in his excitement, &ldquo;not only is your murderer invisible,
      but he makes invisible also the murdered man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angus looked round at the dim room full of dummies, and in some Celtic
      corner of his Scotch soul a shudder started. One of the life-size dolls
      stood immediately overshadowing the blood stain, summoned, perhaps, by the
      slain man an instant before he fell. One of the high-shouldered hooks that
      served the thing for arms, was a little lifted, and Angus had suddenly the
      horrid fancy that poor Smythe&rsquo;s own iron child had struck him down. Matter
      had rebelled, and these machines had killed their master. But even so,
      what had they done with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eaten him?&rdquo; said the nightmare at his ear; and he sickened for an instant
      at the idea of rent, human remains absorbed and crushed into all that
      acephalous clockwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recovered his mental health by an emphatic effort, and said to
      Flambeau, &ldquo;Well, there it is. The poor fellow has evaporated like a cloud
      and left a red streak on the floor. The tale does not belong to this
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one thing to be done,&rdquo; said Flambeau, &ldquo;whether it belongs
      to this world or the other. I must go down and talk to my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended, passing the man with the pail, who again asseverated that
      he had let no intruder pass, down to the commissionaire and the hovering
      chestnut man, who rigidly reasserted their own watchfulness. But when
      Angus looked round for his fourth confirmation he could not see it, and
      called out with some nervousness, &ldquo;Where is the policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Father Brown; &ldquo;that is my fault. I just sent him
      down the road to investigate something&mdash;that I just thought worth
      investigating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we want him back pretty soon,&rdquo; said Angus abruptly, &ldquo;for the
      wretched man upstairs has not only been murdered, but wiped out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Flambeau, after a pause, &ldquo;upon my soul I believe it is more
      in your department than mine. No friend or foe has entered the house, but
      Smythe is gone, as if stolen by the fairies. If that is not supernatural,
      I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke they were all checked by an unusual sight; the big blue
      policeman came round the corner of the crescent, running. He came straight
      up to Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, sir,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve just found poor Mr. Smythe&rsquo;s body
      in the canal down below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angus put his hand wildly to his head. &ldquo;Did he run down and drown
      himself?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never came down, I&rsquo;ll swear,&rdquo; said the constable, &ldquo;and he wasn&rsquo;t
      drowned either, for he died of a great stab over the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you saw no one enter?&rdquo; said Flambeau in a grave voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us walk down the road a little,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they reached the other end of the crescent he observed abruptly,
      &ldquo;Stupid of me! I forgot to ask the policeman something. I wonder if they
      found a light brown sack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a light brown sack?&rdquo; asked Angus, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if it was any other coloured sack, the case must begin over
      again,&rdquo; said Father Brown; &ldquo;but if it was a light brown sack, why, the
      case is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased to hear it,&rdquo; said Angus with hearty irony. &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t begun,
      so far as I am concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell us all about it,&rdquo; said Flambeau with a strange heavy
      simplicity, like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously they were walking with quickening steps down the long sweep
      of road on the other side of the high crescent, Father Brown leading
      briskly, though in silence. At last he said with an almost touching
      vagueness, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll think it so prosy. We always begin at
      the abstract end of things, and you can&rsquo;t begin this story anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever noticed this&mdash;that people never answer what you say?
      They answer what you mean&mdash;or what they think you mean. Suppose one
      lady says to another in a country house, &lsquo;Is anybody staying with you?&rsquo; 
      the lady doesn&rsquo;t answer &lsquo;Yes; the butler, the three footmen, the
      parlourmaid, and so on,&rsquo; though the parlourmaid may be in the room, or the
      butler behind her chair. She says &lsquo;There is nobody staying with us,&rsquo; 
      meaning nobody of the sort you mean. But suppose a doctor inquiring into
      an epidemic asks, &lsquo;Who is staying in the house?&rsquo; then the lady will
      remember the butler, the parlourmaid, and the rest. All language is used
      like that; you never get a question answered literally, even when you get
      it answered truly. When those four quite honest men said that no man had
      gone into the Mansions, they did not really mean that no man had gone into
      them. They meant no man whom they could suspect of being your man. A man
      did go into the house, and did come out of it, but they never noticed
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An invisible man?&rdquo; inquired Angus, raising his red eyebrows. &ldquo;A mentally
      invisible man,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute or two after he resumed in the same unassuming voice, like a man
      thinking his way. &ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t think of such a man, until you do
      think of him. That&rsquo;s where his cleverness comes in. But I came to think of
      him through two or three little things in the tale Mr. Angus told us.
      First, there was the fact that this Welkin went for long walks. And then
      there was the vast lot of stamp paper on the window. And then, most of
      all, there were the two things the young lady said&mdash;things that
      couldn&rsquo;t be true. Don&rsquo;t get annoyed,&rdquo; he added hastily, noting a sudden
      movement of the Scotchman&rsquo;s head; &ldquo;she thought they were true. A person
      can&rsquo;t be quite alone in a street a second before she receives a letter.
      She can&rsquo;t be quite alone in a street when she starts reading a letter just
      received. There must be somebody pretty near her; he must be mentally
      invisible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why must there be somebody near her?&rdquo; asked Angus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;barring carrier-pigeons, somebody must have
      brought her the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean to say,&rdquo; asked Flambeau, with energy, &ldquo;that Welkin
      carried his rival&rsquo;s letters to his lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Welkin carried his rival&rsquo;s letters to his lady.
      You see, he had to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t stand much more of this,&rdquo; exploded Flambeau. &ldquo;Who is this
      fellow? What does he look like? What is the usual get-up of a mentally
      invisible man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dressed rather handsomely in red, blue and gold,&rdquo; replied the
      priest promptly with precision, &ldquo;and in this striking, and even showy,
      costume he entered Himylaya Mansions under eight human eyes; he killed
      Smythe in cold blood, and came down into the street again carrying the
      dead body in his arms&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend sir,&rdquo; cried Angus, standing still, &ldquo;are you raving mad, or am
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not mad,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;only a little unobservant. You have not
      noticed such a man as this, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took three quick strides forward, and put his hand on the shoulder of
      an ordinary passing postman who had bustled by them unnoticed under the
      shade of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever notices postmen somehow,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully; &ldquo;yet they
      have passions like other men, and even carry large bags where a small
      corpse can be stowed quite easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postman, instead of turning naturally, had ducked and tumbled against
      the garden fence. He was a lean fair-bearded man of very ordinary
      appearance, but as he turned an alarmed face over his shoulder, all three
      men were fixed with an almost fiendish squint.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Flambeau went back to his sabres, purple rugs and Persian cat, having many
      things to attend to. John Turnbull Angus went back to the lady at the
      shop, with whom that imprudent young man contrives to be extremely
      comfortable. But Father Brown walked those snow-covered hills under the
      stars for many hours with a murderer, and what they said to each other
      will never be known.

    <h2>
      The Honour of Israel Gow
    </h2>
    <p>
      A stormy evening of olive and silver was closing in, as Father Brown,
      wrapped in a grey Scotch plaid, came to the end of a grey Scotch valley
      and beheld the strange castle of Glengyle. It stopped one end of the glen
      or hollow like a blind alley; and it looked like the end of the world.
      Rising in steep roofs and spires of seagreen slate in the manner of the
      old French-Scotch chateaux, it reminded an Englishman of the sinister
      steeple-hats of witches in fairy tales; and the pine woods that rocked
      round the green turrets looked, by comparison, as black as numberless
      flocks of ravens. This note of a dreamy, almost a sleepy devilry, was no
      mere fancy from the landscape. For there did rest on the place one of
      those clouds of pride and madness and mysterious sorrow which lie more
      heavily on the noble houses of Scotland than on any other of the children
      of men. For Scotland has a double dose of the poison called heredity; the
      sense of blood in the aristocrat, and the sense of doom in the Calvinist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest had snatched a day from his business at Glasgow to meet his
      friend Flambeau, the amateur detective, who was at Glengyle Castle with
      another more formal officer investigating the life and death of the late
      Earl of Glengyle. That mysterious person was the last representative of a
      race whose valour, insanity, and violent cunning had made them terrible
      even among the sinister nobility of their nation in the sixteenth century.
      None were deeper in that labyrinthine ambition, in chamber within chamber
      of that palace of lies that was built up around Mary Queen of Scots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rhyme in the country-side attested the motive and the result of their
      machinations candidly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     As green sap to the simmer trees
     Is red gold to the Ogilvies.
</pre>
    <p>
      For many centuries there had never been a decent lord in Glengyle Castle;
      and with the Victorian era one would have thought that all eccentricities
      were exhausted. The last Glengyle, however, satisfied his tribal tradition
      by doing the only thing that was left for him to do; he disappeared. I do
      not mean that he went abroad; by all accounts he was still in the castle,
      if he was anywhere. But though his name was in the church register and the
      big red Peerage, nobody ever saw him under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone saw him it was a solitary man-servant, something between a groom
      and a gardener. He was so deaf that the more business-like assumed him to
      be dumb; while the more penetrating declared him to be half-witted. A
      gaunt, red-haired labourer, with a dogged jaw and chin, but quite blank
      blue eyes, he went by the name of Israel Gow, and was the one silent
      servant on that deserted estate. But the energy with which he dug
      potatoes, and the regularity with which he disappeared into the kitchen
      gave people an impression that he was providing for the meals of a
      superior, and that the strange earl was still concealed in the castle. If
      society needed any further proof that he was there, the servant
      persistently asserted that he was not at home. One morning the provost and
      the minister (for the Glengyles were Presbyterian) were summoned to the
      castle. There they found that the gardener, groom and cook had added to
      his many professions that of an undertaker, and had nailed up his noble
      master in a coffin. With how much or how little further inquiry this odd
      fact was passed, did not as yet very plainly appear; for the thing had
      never been legally investigated till Flambeau had gone north two or three
      days before. By then the body of Lord Glengyle (if it was the body) had
      lain for some time in the little churchyard on the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Father Brown passed through the dim garden and came under the shadow of
      the chateau, the clouds were thick and the whole air damp and thundery.
      Against the last stripe of the green-gold sunset he saw a black human
      silhouette; a man in a chimney-pot hat, with a big spade over his
      shoulder. The combination was queerly suggestive of a sexton; but when
      Brown remembered the deaf servant who dug potatoes, he thought it natural
      enough. He knew something of the Scotch peasant; he knew the
      respectability which might well feel it necessary to wear &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; for an
      official inquiry; he knew also the economy that would not lose an hour&rsquo;s
      digging for that. Even the man&rsquo;s start and suspicious stare as the priest
      went by were consonant enough with the vigilance and jealousy of such a
      type.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great door was opened by Flambeau himself, who had with him a lean man
      with iron-grey hair and papers in his hand: Inspector Craven from Scotland
      Yard. The entrance hall was mostly stripped and empty; but the pale,
      sneering faces of one or two of the wicked Ogilvies looked down out of
      black periwigs and blackening canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following them into an inner room, Father Brown found that the allies had
      been seated at a long oak table, of which their end was covered with
      scribbled papers, flanked with whisky and cigars. Through the whole of its
      remaining length it was occupied by detached objects arranged at
      intervals; objects about as inexplicable as any objects could be. One
      looked like a small heap of glittering broken glass. Another looked like a
      high heap of brown dust. A third appeared to be a plain stick of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have a sort of geological museum here,&rdquo; he said, as he sat
      down, jerking his head briefly in the direction of the brown dust and the
      crystalline fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a geological museum,&rdquo; replied Flambeau; &ldquo;say a psychological museum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; cried the police detective laughing, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      let&rsquo;s begin with such long words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what psychology means?&rdquo; asked Flambeau with friendly
      surprise. &ldquo;Psychology means being off your chump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I hardly follow,&rdquo; replied the official.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Flambeau, with decision, &ldquo;I mean that we&rsquo;ve only found out
      one thing about Lord Glengyle. He was a maniac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black silhouette of Gow with his top hat and spade passed the window,
      dimly outlined against the darkening sky. Father Brown stared passively at
      it and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand there must have been something odd about the man, or he
      wouldn&rsquo;t have buried himself alive&mdash;nor been in such a hurry to bury
      himself dead. But what makes you think it was lunacy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Flambeau, &ldquo;you just listen to the list of things Mr. Craven
      has found in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get a candle,&rdquo; said Craven, suddenly. &ldquo;A storm is getting up, and
      it&rsquo;s too dark to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you found any candles,&rdquo; asked Brown smiling, &ldquo;among your oddities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau raised a grave face, and fixed his dark eyes on his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is curious, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Twenty-five candles, and not a trace of
      a candlestick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the rapidly darkening room and rapidly rising wind, Brown went along
      the table to where a bundle of wax candles lay among the other scrappy
      exhibits. As he did so he bent accidentally over the heap of red-brown
      dust; and a sharp sneeze cracked the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;snuff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took one of the candles, lit it carefully, came back and stuck it in
      the neck of the whisky bottle. The unrestful night air, blowing through
      the crazy window, waved the long flame like a banner. And on every side of
      the castle they could hear the miles and miles of black pine wood seething
      like a black sea around a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will read the inventory,&rdquo; began Craven gravely, picking up one of the
      papers, &ldquo;the inventory of what we found loose and unexplained in the
      castle. You are to understand that the place generally was dismantled and
      neglected; but one or two rooms had plainly been inhabited in a simple but
      not squalid style by somebody; somebody who was not the servant Gow. The
      list is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First item. A very considerable hoard of precious stones, nearly all
      diamonds, and all of them loose, without any setting whatever. Of course,
      it is natural that the Ogilvies should have family jewels; but those are
      exactly the jewels that are almost always set in particular articles of
      ornament. The Ogilvies would seem to have kept theirs loose in their
      pockets, like coppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second item. Heaps and heaps of loose snuff, not kept in a horn, or even
      a pouch, but lying in heaps on the mantelpieces, on the sideboard, on the
      piano, anywhere. It looks as if the old gentleman would not take the
      trouble to look in a pocket or lift a lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third item. Here and there about the house curious little heaps of minute
      pieces of metal, some like steel springs and some in the form of
      microscopic wheels. As if they had gutted some mechanical toy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourth item. The wax candles, which have to be stuck in bottle necks
      because there is nothing else to stick them in. Now I wish you to note how
      very much queerer all this is than anything we anticipated. For the
      central riddle we are prepared; we have all seen at a glance that there
      was something wrong about the last earl. We have come here to find out
      whether he really lived here, whether he really died here, whether that
      red-haired scarecrow who did his burying had anything to do with his
      dying. But suppose the worst in all this, the most lurid or melodramatic
      solution you like. Suppose the servant really killed the master, or
      suppose the master isn&rsquo;t really dead, or suppose the master is dressed up
      as the servant, or suppose the servant is buried for the master; invent
      what Wilkie Collins&rsquo; tragedy you like, and you still have not explained a
      candle without a candlestick, or why an elderly gentleman of good family
      should habitually spill snuff on the piano. The core of the tale we could
      imagine; it is the fringes that are mysterious. By no stretch of fancy can
      the human mind connect together snuff and diamonds and wax and loose
      clockwork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see the connection,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;This Glengyle was mad
      against the French Revolution. He was an enthusiast for the ancien regime,
      and was trying to re-enact literally the family life of the last Bourbons.
      He had snuff because it was the eighteenth century luxury; wax candles,
      because they were the eighteenth century lighting; the mechanical bits of
      iron represent the locksmith hobby of Louis XVI; the diamonds are for the
      Diamond Necklace of Marie Antoinette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the other men were staring at him with round eyes. &ldquo;What a perfectly
      extraordinary notion!&rdquo; cried Flambeau. &ldquo;Do you really think that is the
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly sure it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Father Brown, &ldquo;only you said that
      nobody could connect snuff and diamonds and clockwork and candles. I give
      you that connection off-hand. The real truth, I am very sure, lies
      deeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment and listened to the wailing of the wind in the turrets.
      Then he said, &ldquo;The late Earl of Glengyle was a thief. He lived a second
      and darker life as a desperate housebreaker. He did not have any
      candlesticks because he only used these candles cut short in the little
      lantern he carried. The snuff he employed as the fiercest French criminals
      have used pepper: to fling it suddenly in dense masses in the face of a
      captor or pursuer. But the final proof is in the curious coincidence of
      the diamonds and the small steel wheels. Surely that makes everything
      plain to you? Diamonds and small steel wheels are the only two instruments
      with which you can cut out a pane of glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bough of a broken pine tree lashed heavily in the blast against the
      windowpane behind them, as if in parody of a burglar, but they did not
      turn round. Their eyes were fastened on Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diamonds and small wheels,&rdquo; repeated Craven ruminating. &ldquo;Is that all that
      makes you think it the true explanation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it the true explanation,&rdquo; replied the priest placidly; &ldquo;but
      you said that nobody could connect the four things. The true tale, of
      course, is something much more humdrum. Glengyle had found, or thought he
      had found, precious stones on his estate. Somebody had bamboozled him with
      those loose brilliants, saying they were found in the castle caverns. The
      little wheels are some diamond-cutting affair. He had to do the thing very
      roughly and in a small way, with the help of a few shepherds or rude
      fellows on these hills. Snuff is the one great luxury of such Scotch
      shepherds; it&rsquo;s the one thing with which you can bribe them. They didn&rsquo;t
      have candlesticks because they didn&rsquo;t want them; they held the candles in
      their hands when they explored the caves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Flambeau after a long pause. &ldquo;Have we got to the dull
      truth at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the wind died in the most distant pine woods with a long hoot as of
      mockery Father Brown, with an utterly impassive face, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only suggested that because you said one could not plausibly connect
      snuff with clockwork or candles with bright stones. Ten false philosophies
      will fit the universe; ten false theories will fit Glengyle Castle. But we
      want the real explanation of the castle and the universe. But are there no
      other exhibits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craven laughed, and Flambeau rose smiling to his feet and strolled down
      the long table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Items five, six, seven, etc.,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and certainly more varied than
      instructive. A curious collection, not of lead pencils, but of the lead
      out of lead pencils. A senseless stick of bamboo, with the top rather
      splintered. It might be the instrument of the crime. Only, there isn&rsquo;t any
      crime. The only other things are a few old missals and little Catholic
      pictures, which the Ogilvies kept, I suppose, from the Middle Ages&mdash;their
      family pride being stronger than their Puritanism. We only put them in the
      museum because they seem curiously cut about and defaced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heady tempest without drove a dreadful wrack of clouds across Glengyle
      and threw the long room into darkness as Father Brown picked up the little
      illuminated pages to examine them. He spoke before the drift of darkness
      had passed; but it was the voice of an utterly new man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Craven,&rdquo; said he, talking like a man ten years younger, &ldquo;you have got
      a legal warrant, haven&rsquo;t you, to go up and examine that grave? The sooner
      we do it the better, and get to the bottom of this horrible affair. If I
      were you I should start now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; repeated the astonished detective, &ldquo;and why now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this is serious,&rdquo; answered Brown; &ldquo;this is not spilt snuff or
      loose pebbles, that might be there for a hundred reasons. There is only
      one reason I know of for this being done; and the reason goes down to the
      roots of the world. These religious pictures are not just dirtied or torn
      or scrawled over, which might be done in idleness or bigotry, by children
      or by Protestants. These have been treated very carefully&mdash;and very
      queerly. In every place where the great ornamented name of God comes in
      the old illuminations it has been elaborately taken out. The only other
      thing that has been removed is the halo round the head of the Child Jesus.
      Therefore, I say, let us get our warrant and our spade and our hatchet,
      and go up and break open that coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the London officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; answered the little priest, and his voice seemed to rise
      slightly in the roar of the gale. &ldquo;I mean that the great devil of the
      universe may be sitting on the top tower of this castle at this moment, as
      big as a hundred elephants, and roaring like the Apocalypse. There is
      black magic somewhere at the bottom of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black magic,&rdquo; repeated Flambeau in a low voice, for he was too
      enlightened a man not to know of such things; &ldquo;but what can these other
      things mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, something damnable, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Brown impatiently. &ldquo;How
      should I know? How can I guess all their mazes down below? Perhaps you can
      make a torture out of snuff and bamboo. Perhaps lunatics lust after wax
      and steel filings. Perhaps there is a maddening drug made of lead pencils!
      Our shortest cut to the mystery is up the hill to the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His comrades hardly knew that they had obeyed and followed him till a
      blast of the night wind nearly flung them on their faces in the garden.
      Nevertheless they had obeyed him like automata; for Craven found a hatchet
      in his hand, and the warrant in his pocket; Flambeau was carrying the
      heavy spade of the strange gardener; Father Brown was carrying the little
      gilt book from which had been torn the name of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path up the hill to the churchyard was crooked but short; only under
      that stress of wind it seemed laborious and long. Far as the eye could
      see, farther and farther as they mounted the slope, were seas beyond seas
      of pines, now all aslope one way under the wind. And that universal
      gesture seemed as vain as it was vast, as vain as if that wind were
      whistling about some unpeopled and purposeless planet. Through all that
      infinite growth of grey-blue forests sang, shrill and high, that ancient
      sorrow that is in the heart of all heathen things. One could fancy that
      the voices from the under world of unfathomable foliage were cries of the
      lost and wandering pagan gods: gods who had gone roaming in that
      irrational forest, and who will never find their way back to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Father Brown in low but easy tone, &ldquo;Scotch people before
      Scotland existed were a curious lot. In fact, they&rsquo;re a curious lot still.
      But in the prehistoric times I fancy they really worshipped demons. That,&rdquo;
       he added genially, &ldquo;is why they jumped at the Puritan theology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Flambeau, turning in a kind of fury, &ldquo;what does all that
      snuff mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; replied Brown, with equal seriousness, &ldquo;there is one mark of
      all genuine religions: materialism. Now, devil-worship is a perfectly
      genuine religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had come up on the grassy scalp of the hill, one of the few bald
      spots that stood clear of the crashing and roaring pine forest. A mean
      enclosure, partly timber and partly wire, rattled in the tempest to tell
      them the border of the graveyard. But by the time Inspector Craven had
      come to the corner of the grave, and Flambeau had planted his spade point
      downwards and leaned on it, they were both almost as shaken as the shaky
      wood and wire. At the foot of the grave grew great tall thistles, grey and
      silver in their decay. Once or twice, when a ball of thistledown broke
      under the breeze and flew past him, Craven jumped slightly as if it had
      been an arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau drove the blade of his spade through the whistling grass into the
      wet clay below. Then he seemed to stop and lean on it as on a staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the priest very gently. &ldquo;We are only trying to find the
      truth. What are you afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid of finding it,&rdquo; said Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      The London detective spoke suddenly in a high crowing voice that was meant
      to be conversational and cheery. &ldquo;I wonder why he really did hide himself
      like that. Something nasty, I suppose; was he a leper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something worse than that,&rdquo; said Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you imagine,&rdquo; asked the other, &ldquo;would be worse than a leper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine it,&rdquo; said Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dug for some dreadful minutes in silence, and then said in a choked
      voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of his not being the right shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor was that piece of paper, you know,&rdquo; said Father Brown quietly, &ldquo;and
      we survived even that piece of paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau dug on with a blind energy. But the tempest had shouldered away
      the choking grey clouds that clung to the hills like smoke and revealed
      grey fields of faint starlight before he cleared the shape of a rude
      timber coffin, and somehow tipped it up upon the turf. Craven stepped
      forward with his axe; a thistle-top touched him, and he flinched. Then he
      took a firmer stride, and hacked and wrenched with an energy like
      Flambeau&rsquo;s till the lid was torn off, and all that was there lay
      glimmering in the grey starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bones,&rdquo; said Craven; and then he added, &ldquo;but it is a man,&rdquo; as if that
      were something unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he,&rdquo; asked Flambeau in a voice that went oddly up and down, &ldquo;is he all
      right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems so,&rdquo; said the officer huskily, bending over the obscure and
      decaying skeleton in the box. &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vast heave went over Flambeau&rsquo;s huge figure. &ldquo;And now I come to think of
      it,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;why in the name of madness shouldn&rsquo;t he be all right? What
      is it gets hold of a man on these cursed cold mountains? I think it&rsquo;s the
      black, brainless repetition; all these forests, and over all an ancient
      horror of unconsciousness. It&rsquo;s like the dream of an atheist. Pine-trees
      and more pine-trees and millions more pine-trees&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; cried the man by the coffin, &ldquo;but he hasn&rsquo;t got a head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the others stood rigid the priest, for the first time, showed a leap
      of startled concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No head!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;No head?&rdquo; as if he had almost expected some other
      deficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-witted visions of a headless baby born to Glengyle, of a headless
      youth hiding himself in the castle, of a headless man pacing those ancient
      halls or that gorgeous garden, passed in panorama through their minds. But
      even in that stiffened instant the tale took no root in them and seemed to
      have no reason in it. They stood listening to the loud woods and the
      shrieking sky quite foolishly, like exhausted animals. Thought seemed to
      be something enormous that had suddenly slipped out of their grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three headless men,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;standing round this
      open grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pale detective from London opened his mouth to speak, and left it open
      like a yokel, while a long scream of wind tore the sky; then he looked at
      the axe in his hands as if it did not belong to him, and dropped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Flambeau in that infantile and heavy voice he used very
      seldom, &ldquo;what are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend&rsquo;s reply came with the pent promptitude of a gun going off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep!&rdquo; cried Father Brown. &ldquo;Sleep. We have come to the end of the ways.
      Do you know what sleep is? Do you know that every man who sleeps believes
      in God? It is a sacrament; for it is an act of faith and it is a food. And
      we need a sacrament, if only a natural one. Something has fallen on us
      that falls very seldom on men; perhaps the worst thing that can fall on
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craven&rsquo;s parted lips came together to say, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest had turned his face to the castle as he answered: &ldquo;We have
      found the truth; and the truth makes no sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went down the path in front of them with a plunging and reckless step
      very rare with him, and when they reached the castle again he threw
      himself upon sleep with the simplicity of a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his mystic praise of slumber, Father Brown was up earlier than
      anyone else except the silent gardener; and was found smoking a big pipe
      and watching that expert at his speechless labours in the kitchen garden.
      Towards daybreak the rocking storm had ended in roaring rains, and the day
      came with a curious freshness. The gardener seemed even to have been
      conversing, but at sight of the detectives he planted his spade sullenly
      in a bed and, saying something about his breakfast, shifted along the
      lines of cabbages and shut himself in the kitchen. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a valuable man,
      that,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;He does the potatoes amazingly. Still,&rdquo; he
      added, with a dispassionate charity, &ldquo;he has his faults; which of us
      hasn&rsquo;t? He doesn&rsquo;t dig this bank quite regularly. There, for instance,&rdquo;
       and he stamped suddenly on one spot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really very doubtful about that
      potato.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; asked Craven, amused with the little man&rsquo;s hobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doubtful about it,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;because old Gow was doubtful
      about it himself. He put his spade in methodically in every place but just
      this. There must be a mighty fine potato just here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau pulled up the spade and impetuously drove it into the place. He
      turned up, under a load of soil, something that did not look like a
      potato, but rather like a monstrous, over-domed mushroom. But it struck
      the spade with a cold click; it rolled over like a ball, and grinned up at
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Earl of Glengyle,&rdquo; said Brown sadly, and looked down heavily at the
      skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a momentary meditation, he plucked the spade from Flambeau,
      and, saying &ldquo;We must hide it again,&rdquo; clamped the skull down in the earth.
      Then he leaned his little body and huge head on the great handle of the
      spade, that stood up stiffly in the earth, and his eyes were empty and his
      forehead full of wrinkles. &ldquo;If one could only conceive,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;the
      meaning of this last monstrosity.&rdquo; And leaning on the large spade handle,
      he buried his brows in his hands, as men do in church.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the corners of the sky were brightening into blue and silver; the
      birds were chattering in the tiny garden trees; so loud it seemed as if
      the trees themselves were talking. But the three men were silent enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I give it all up,&rdquo; said Flambeau at last boisterously. &ldquo;My brain
      and this world don&rsquo;t fit each other; and there&rsquo;s an end of it. Snuff,
      spoilt Prayer Books, and the insides of musical boxes&mdash;what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown threw up his bothered brow and rapped on the spade handle with an
      intolerance quite unusual with him. &ldquo;Oh, tut, tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;All that is as plain as a pikestaff. I understood the snuff and
      clockwork, and so on, when I first opened my eyes this morning. And since
      then I&rsquo;ve had it out with old Gow, the gardener, who is neither so deaf
      nor so stupid as he pretends. There&rsquo;s nothing amiss about the loose items.
      I was wrong about the torn mass-book, too; there&rsquo;s no harm in that. But
      it&rsquo;s this last business. Desecrating graves and stealing dead men&rsquo;s heads&mdash;surely
      there&rsquo;s harm in that? Surely there&rsquo;s black magic still in that? That
      doesn&rsquo;t fit in to the quite simple story of the snuff and the candles.&rdquo;
       And, striding about again, he smoked moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Flambeau, with a grim humour, &ldquo;you must be careful with
      me and remember I was once a criminal. The great advantage of that estate
      was that I always made up the story myself, and acted it as quick as I
      chose. This detective business of waiting about is too much for my French
      impatience. All my life, for good or evil, I have done things at the
      instant; I always fought duels the next morning; I always paid bills on
      the nail; I never even put off a visit to the dentist&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown&rsquo;s pipe fell out of his mouth and broke into three pieces on
      the gravel path. He stood rolling his eyes, the exact picture of an idiot.
      &ldquo;Lord, what a turnip I am!&rdquo; he kept saying. &ldquo;Lord, what a turnip!&rdquo; Then,
      in a somewhat groggy kind of way, he began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dentist!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Six hours in the spiritual abyss, and all
      because I never thought of the dentist! Such a simple, such a beautiful
      and peaceful thought! Friends, we have passed a night in hell; but now the
      sun is risen, the birds are singing, and the radiant form of the dentist
      consoles the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will get some sense out of this,&rdquo; cried Flambeau, striding forward, &ldquo;if
      I use the tortures of the Inquisition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown repressed what appeared to be a momentary disposition to
      dance on the now sunlit lawn and cried quite piteously, like a child, &ldquo;Oh,
      let me be silly a little. You don&rsquo;t know how unhappy I have been. And now
      I know that there has been no deep sin in this business at all. Only a
      little lunacy, perhaps&mdash;and who minds that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spun round once more, then faced them with gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not a story of crime,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;rather it is the story of a
      strange and crooked honesty. We are dealing with the one man on earth,
      perhaps, who has taken no more than his due. It is a study in the savage
      living logic that has been the religion of this race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That old local rhyme about the house of Glengyle&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     As green sap to the simmer trees
     Is red gold to the Ogilvies&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      was literal as well as metaphorical. It did not merely mean that the
      Glengyles sought for wealth; it was also true that they literally gathered
      gold; they had a huge collection of ornaments and utensils in that metal.
      They were, in fact, misers whose mania took that turn. In the light of
      that fact, run through all the things we found in the castle. Diamonds
      without their gold rings; candles without their gold candlesticks; snuff
      without the gold snuff-boxes; pencil-leads without the gold pencil-cases;
      a walking stick without its gold top; clockwork without the gold clocks&mdash;or
      rather watches. And, mad as it sounds, because the halos and the name of
      God in the old missals were of real gold; these also were taken away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The garden seemed to brighten, the grass to grow gayer in the
      strengthening sun, as the crazy truth was told. Flambeau lit a cigarette
      as his friend went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were taken away,&rdquo; continued Father Brown; &ldquo;were taken away&mdash;but not
      stolen. Thieves would never have left this mystery. Thieves would have
      taken the gold snuff-boxes, snuff and all; the gold pencil-cases, lead and
      all. We have to deal with a man with a peculiar conscience, but certainly
      a conscience. I found that mad moralist this morning in the kitchen garden
      yonder, and I heard the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The late Archibald Ogilvie was the nearest approach to a good man ever
      born at Glengyle. But his bitter virtue took the turn of the misanthrope;
      he moped over the dishonesty of his ancestors, from which, somehow, he
      generalised a dishonesty of all men. More especially he distrusted
      philanthropy or free-giving; and he swore if he could find one man who
      took his exact rights he should have all the gold of Glengyle. Having
      delivered this defiance to humanity he shut himself up, without the
      smallest expectation of its being answered. One day, however, a deaf and
      seemingly senseless lad from a distant village brought him a belated
      telegram; and Glengyle, in his acrid pleasantry, gave him a new farthing.
      At least he thought he had done so, but when he turned over his change he
      found the new farthing still there and a sovereign gone. The accident
      offered him vistas of sneering speculation. Either way, the boy would show
      the greasy greed of the species. Either he would vanish, a thief stealing
      a coin; or he would sneak back with it virtuously, a snob seeking a
      reward. In the middle of that night Lord Glengyle was knocked up out of
      his bed&mdash;for he lived alone&mdash;and forced to open the door to the
      deaf idiot. The idiot brought with him, not the sovereign, but exactly
      nineteen shillings and eleven-pence three-farthings in change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the wild exactitude of this action took hold of the mad lord&rsquo;s brain
      like fire. He swore he was Diogenes, that had long sought an honest man,
      and at last had found one. He made a new will, which I have seen. He took
      the literal youth into his huge, neglected house, and trained him up as
      his solitary servant and&mdash;after an odd manner&mdash;his heir. And
      whatever that queer creature understands, he understood absolutely his
      lord&rsquo;s two fixed ideas: first, that the letter of right is everything; and
      second, that he himself was to have the gold of Glengyle. So far, that is
      all; and that is simple. He has stripped the house of gold, and taken not
      a grain that was not gold; not so much as a grain of snuff. He lifted the
      gold leaf off an old illumination, fully satisfied that he left the rest
      unspoilt. All that I understood; but I could not understand this skull
      business. I was really uneasy about that human head buried among the
      potatoes. It distressed me&mdash;till Flambeau said the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all right. He will put the skull back in the grave, when he
      has taken the gold out of the tooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, when Flambeau crossed the hill that morning, he saw that
      strange being, the just miser, digging at the desecrated grave, the plaid
      round his throat thrashing out in the mountain wind; the sober top hat on
      his head.

    <h2>
      The Wrong Shape
    </h2>
    <p>
      Certain of the great roads going north out of London continue far into the
      country a sort of attenuated and interrupted spectre of a street, with
      great gaps in the building, but preserving the line. Here will be a group
      of shops, followed by a fenced field or paddock, and then a famous
      public-house, and then perhaps a market garden or a nursery garden, and
      then one large private house, and then another field and another inn, and
      so on. If anyone walks along one of these roads he will pass a house which
      will probably catch his eye, though he may not be able to explain its
      attraction. It is a long, low house, running parallel with the road,
      painted mostly white and pale green, with a veranda and sun-blinds, and
      porches capped with those quaint sort of cupolas like wooden umbrellas
      that one sees in some old-fashioned houses. In fact, it is an
      old-fashioned house, very English and very suburban in the good old
      wealthy Clapham sense. And yet the house has a look of having been built
      chiefly for the hot weather. Looking at its white paint and sun-blinds one
      thinks vaguely of pugarees and even of palm trees. I cannot trace the
      feeling to its root; perhaps the place was built by an Anglo-Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone passing this house, I say, would be namelessly fascinated by it;
      would feel that it was a place about which some story was to be told. And
      he would have been right, as you shall shortly hear. For this is the story&mdash;the
      story of the strange things that did really happen in it in the
      Whitsuntide of the year 18&mdash;:
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone passing the house on the Thursday before Whit-Sunday at about
      half-past four p.m. would have seen the front door open, and Father Brown,
      of the small church of St. Mungo, come out smoking a large pipe in company
      with a very tall French friend of his called Flambeau, who was smoking a
      very small cigarette. These persons may or may not be of interest to the
      reader, but the truth is that they were not the only interesting things
      that were displayed when the front door of the white-and-green house was
      opened. There are further peculiarities about this house, which must be
      described to start with, not only that the reader may understand this
      tragic tale, but also that he may realise what it was that the opening of
      the door revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole house was built upon the plan of a T, but a T with a very long
      cross piece and a very short tail piece. The long cross piece was the
      frontage that ran along in face of the street, with the front door in the
      middle; it was two stories high, and contained nearly all the important
      rooms. The short tail piece, which ran out at the back immediately
      opposite the front door, was one story high, and consisted only of two
      long rooms, the one leading into the other. The first of these two rooms
      was the study in which the celebrated Mr. Quinton wrote his wild Oriental
      poems and romances. The farther room was a glass conservatory full of
      tropical blossoms of quite unique and almost monstrous beauty, and on such
      afternoons as these glowing with gorgeous sunlight. Thus when the hall
      door was open, many a passer-by literally stopped to stare and gasp; for
      he looked down a perspective of rich apartments to something really like a
      transformation scene in a fairy play: purple clouds and golden suns and
      crimson stars that were at once scorchingly vivid and yet transparent and
      far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard Quinton, the poet, had himself most carefully arranged this
      effect; and it is doubtful whether he so perfectly expressed his
      personality in any of his poems. For he was a man who drank and bathed in
      colours, who indulged his lust for colour somewhat to the neglect of form&mdash;even
      of good form. This it was that had turned his genius so wholly to eastern
      art and imagery; to those bewildering carpets or blinding embroideries in
      which all the colours seem fallen into a fortunate chaos, having nothing
      to typify or to teach. He had attempted, not perhaps with complete
      artistic success, but with acknowledged imagination and invention, to
      compose epics and love stories reflecting the riot of violent and even
      cruel colour; tales of tropical heavens of burning gold or blood-red
      copper; of eastern heroes who rode with twelve-turbaned mitres upon
      elephants painted purple or peacock green; of gigantic jewels that a
      hundred negroes could not carry, but which burned with ancient and
      strange-hued fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short (to put the matter from the more common point of view), he dealt
      much in eastern heavens, rather worse than most western hells; in eastern
      monarchs, whom we might possibly call maniacs; and in eastern jewels which
      a Bond Street jeweller (if the hundred staggering negroes brought them
      into his shop) might possibly not regard as genuine. Quinton was a genius,
      if a morbid one; and even his morbidity appeared more in his life than in
      his work. In temperament he was weak and waspish, and his health had
      suffered heavily from oriental experiments with opium. His wife&mdash;a
      handsome, hard-working, and, indeed, over-worked woman objected to the
      opium, but objected much more to a live Indian hermit in white and yellow
      robes, whom her husband insisted on entertaining for months together, a
      Virgil to guide his spirit through the heavens and the hells of the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was out of this artistic household that Father Brown and his friend
      stepped on to the door-step; and to judge from their faces, they stepped
      out of it with much relief. Flambeau had known Quinton in wild student
      days in Paris, and they had renewed the acquaintance for a week-end; but
      apart from Flambeau&rsquo;s more responsible developments of late, he did not
      get on well with the poet now. Choking oneself with opium and writing
      little erotic verses on vellum was not his notion of how a gentleman
      should go to the devil. As the two paused on the door-step, before taking
      a turn in the garden, the front garden gate was thrown open with violence,
      and a young man with a billycock hat on the back of his head tumbled up
      the steps in his eagerness. He was a dissipated-looking youth with a
      gorgeous red necktie all awry, as if he had slept in it, and he kept
      fidgeting and lashing about with one of those little jointed canes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said breathlessly, &ldquo;I want to see old Quinton. I must see him.
      Has he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quinton is in, I believe,&rdquo; said Father Brown, cleaning his pipe, &ldquo;but
      I do not know if you can see him. The doctor is with him at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who seemed not to be perfectly sober, stumbled into the
      hall; and at the same moment the doctor came out of Quinton&rsquo;s study,
      shutting the door and beginning to put on his gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See Mr. Quinton?&rdquo; said the doctor coolly. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t. In
      fact, you mustn&rsquo;t on any account. Nobody must see him; I&rsquo;ve just given him
      his sleeping draught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but look here, old chap,&rdquo; said the youth in the red tie, trying
      affectionately to capture the doctor by the lapels of his coat. &ldquo;Look
      here. I&rsquo;m simply sewn up, I tell you. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Mr. Atkinson,&rdquo; said the doctor, forcing him to fall back;
      &ldquo;when you can alter the effects of a drug I&rsquo;ll alter my decision,&rdquo; and,
      settling on his hat, he stepped out into the sunlight with the other two.
      He was a bull-necked, good-tempered little man with a small moustache,
      inexpressibly ordinary, yet giving an impression of capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man in the billycock, who did not seem to be gifted with any
      tact in dealing with people beyond the general idea of clutching hold of
      their coats, stood outside the door, as dazed as if he had been thrown out
      bodily, and silently watched the other three walk away together through
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a sound, spanking lie I told just now,&rdquo; remarked the medical
      man, laughing. &ldquo;In point of fact, poor Quinton doesn&rsquo;t have his sleeping
      draught for nearly half an hour. But I&rsquo;m not going to have him bothered
      with that little beast, who only wants to borrow money that he wouldn&rsquo;t
      pay back if he could. He&rsquo;s a dirty little scamp, though he is Mrs.
      Quinton&rsquo;s brother, and she&rsquo;s as fine a woman as ever walked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I propose to hang about the garden till the creature has cleared off,&rdquo;
       went on the doctor, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;ll go in to Quinton with the medicine.
      Atkinson can&rsquo;t get in, because I locked the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, Dr. Harris,&rdquo; said Flambeau, &ldquo;we might as well walk round at
      the back by the end of the conservatory. There&rsquo;s no entrance to it that
      way, but it&rsquo;s worth seeing, even from the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I might get a squint at my patient,&rdquo; laughed the doctor, &ldquo;for he
      prefers to lie on an ottoman right at the end of the conservatory amid all
      those blood-red poinsettias; it would give me the creeps. But what are you
      doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown had stopped for a moment, and picked up out of the long
      grass, where it had almost been wholly hidden, a queer, crooked Oriental
      knife, inlaid exquisitely in coloured stones and metals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Father Brown, regarding it with some disfavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Quinton&rsquo;s, I suppose,&rdquo; said Dr. Harris carelessly; &ldquo;he has all sorts
      of Chinese knickknacks about the place. Or perhaps it belongs to that mild
      Hindoo of his whom he keeps on a string.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Hindoo?&rdquo; asked Father Brown, still staring at the dagger in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, some Indian conjuror,&rdquo; said the doctor lightly; &ldquo;a fraud, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in magic?&rdquo; asked Father Brown, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O crickey! magic!&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very beautiful,&rdquo; said the priest in a low, dreaming voice; &ldquo;the
      colours are very beautiful. But it&rsquo;s the wrong shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Flambeau, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For anything. It&rsquo;s the wrong shape in the abstract. Don&rsquo;t you ever feel
      that about Eastern art? The colours are intoxicatingly lovely; but the
      shapes are mean and bad&mdash;deliberately mean and bad. I have seen
      wicked things in a Turkey carpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; cried Flambeau, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are letters and symbols in a language I don&rsquo;t know; but I know they
      stand for evil words,&rdquo; went on the priest, his voice growing lower and
      lower. &ldquo;The lines go wrong on purpose&mdash;like serpents doubling to
      escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil are you talking about?&rdquo; said the doctor with a loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau spoke quietly to him in answer. &ldquo;The Father sometimes gets this
      mystic&rsquo;s cloud on him,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I give you fair warning that I have
      never known him to have it except when there was some evil quite near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rats!&rdquo; said the scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look at it,&rdquo; cried Father Brown, holding out the crooked knife at
      arm&rsquo;s length, as if it were some glittering snake. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it is
      the wrong shape? Don&rsquo;t you see that it has no hearty and plain purpose? It
      does not point like a spear. It does not sweep like a scythe. It does not
      look like a weapon. It looks like an instrument of torture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you don&rsquo;t seem to like it,&rdquo; said the jolly Harris, &ldquo;it had
      better be taken back to its owner. Haven&rsquo;t we come to the end of this
      confounded conservatory yet? This house is the wrong shape, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Father Brown, shaking his head. &ldquo;The shape of
      this house is quaint&mdash;it is even laughable. But there is nothing
      wrong about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they spoke they came round the curve of glass that ended the
      conservatory, an uninterrupted curve, for there was neither door nor
      window by which to enter at that end. The glass, however, was clear, and
      the sun still bright, though beginning to set; and they could see not only
      the flamboyant blossoms inside, but the frail figure of the poet in a
      brown velvet coat lying languidly on the sofa, having, apparently, fallen
      half asleep over a book. He was a pale, slight man, with loose, chestnut
      hair and a fringe of beard that was the paradox of his face, for the beard
      made him look less manly. These traits were well known to all three of
      them; but even had it not been so, it may be doubted whether they would
      have looked at Quinton just then. Their eyes were riveted on another
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly in their path, immediately outside the round end of the glass
      building, was standing a tall man, whose drapery fell to his feet in
      faultless white, and whose bare, brown skull, face, and neck gleamed in
      the setting sun like splendid bronze. He was looking through the glass at
      the sleeper, and he was more motionless than a mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; cried Father Brown, stepping back with a hissing intake of
      his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is only that Hindoo humbug,&rdquo; growled Harris; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know
      what the deuce he&rsquo;s doing here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like hypnotism,&rdquo; said Flambeau, biting his black moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you unmedical fellows always talking bosh about hypnotism?&rdquo; cried
      the doctor. &ldquo;It looks a deal more like burglary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will speak to it, at any rate,&rdquo; said Flambeau, who was always
      for action. One long stride took him to the place where the Indian stood.
      Bowing from his great height, which overtopped even the Oriental&rsquo;s, he
      said with placid impudence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, sir. Do you want anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite slowly, like a great ship turning into a harbour, the great yellow
      face turned, and looked at last over its white shoulder. They were
      startled to see that its yellow eyelids were quite sealed, as in sleep.
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the face in excellent English. &ldquo;I want nothing.&rdquo; Then,
      half opening the lids, so as to show a slit of opalescent eyeball, he
      repeated, &ldquo;I want nothing.&rdquo; Then he opened his eyes wide with a startling
      stare, said, &ldquo;I want nothing,&rdquo; and went rustling away into the rapidly
      darkening garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Christian is more modest,&rdquo; muttered Father Brown; &ldquo;he wants
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth was he doing?&rdquo; asked Flambeau, knitting his black brows and
      lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to talk to you later,&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight was still a reality, but it was the red light of evening, and
      the bulk of the garden trees and bushes grew blacker and blacker against
      it. They turned round the end of the conservatory, and walked in silence
      down the other side to get round to the front door. As they went they
      seemed to wake something, as one startles a bird, in the deeper corner
      between the study and the main building; and again they saw the
      white-robed fakir slide out of the shadow, and slip round towards the
      front door. To their surprise, however, he had not been alone. They found
      themselves abruptly pulled up and forced to banish their bewilderment by
      the appearance of Mrs. Quinton, with her heavy golden hair and square pale
      face, advancing on them out of the twilight. She looked a little stern,
      but was entirely courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Dr. Harris,&rdquo; was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mrs. Quinton,&rdquo; said the little doctor heartily. &ldquo;I am just
      going to give your husband his sleeping draught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said in a clear voice. &ldquo;I think it is quite time.&rdquo; And she
      smiled at them, and went sweeping into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman&rsquo;s over-driven,&rdquo; said Father Brown; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the kind of woman
      that does her duty for twenty years, and then does something dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little doctor looked at him for the first time with an eye of
      interest. &ldquo;Did you ever study medicine?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to know something of the mind as well as the body,&rdquo; answered the
      priest; &ldquo;we have to know something of the body as well as the mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and give Quinton his stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had turned the corner of the front facade, and were approaching the
      front doorway. As they turned into it they saw the man in the white robe
      for the third time. He came so straight towards the front door that it
      seemed quite incredible that he had not just come out of the study
      opposite to it. Yet they knew that the study door was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown and Flambeau, however, kept this weird contradiction to
      themselves, and Dr. Harris was not a man to waste his thoughts on the
      impossible. He permitted the omnipresent Asiatic to make his exit, and
      then stepped briskly into the hall. There he found a figure which he had
      already forgotten. The inane Atkinson was still hanging about, humming and
      poking things with his knobby cane. The doctor&rsquo;s face had a spasm of
      disgust and decision, and he whispered rapidly to his companion: &ldquo;I must
      lock the door again, or this rat will get in. But I shall be out again in
      two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rapidly unlocked the door and locked it again behind him, just balking
      a blundering charge from the young man in the billycock. The young man
      threw himself impatiently on a hall chair. Flambeau looked at a Persian
      illumination on the wall; Father Brown, who seemed in a sort of daze,
      dully eyed the door. In about four minutes the door was opened again.
      Atkinson was quicker this time. He sprang forward, held the door open for
      an instant, and called out: &ldquo;Oh, I say, Quinton, I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the other end of the study came the clear voice of Quinton, in
      something between a yawn and a yell of weary laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know what you want. Take it, and leave me in peace. I&rsquo;m writing a
      song about peacocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the door closed half a sovereign came flying through the aperture;
      and Atkinson, stumbling forward, caught it with singular dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; said the doctor, and, locking the door savagely, he
      led the way out into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Leonard can get a little peace now,&rdquo; he added to Father Brown; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      locked in all by himself for an hour or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the priest; &ldquo;and his voice sounded jolly enough when we
      left him.&rdquo; Then he looked gravely round the garden, and saw the loose
      figure of Atkinson standing and jingling the half-sovereign in his pocket,
      and beyond, in the purple twilight, the figure of the Indian sitting bolt
      upright upon a bank of grass with his face turned towards the setting sun.
      Then he said abruptly: &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Quinton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has gone up to her room,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;That is her shadow on the
      blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown looked up, and frowningly scrutinised a dark outline at the
      gas-lit window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is her shadow,&rdquo; and he walked a yard or two and
      threw himself upon a garden seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau sat down beside him; but the doctor was one of those energetic
      people who live naturally on their legs. He walked away, smoking, into the
      twilight, and the two friends were left together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said Flambeau in French, &ldquo;what is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown was silent and motionless for half a minute, then he said:
      &ldquo;Superstition is irreligious, but there is something in the air of this
      place. I think it&rsquo;s that Indian&mdash;at least, partly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank into silence, and watched the distant outline of the Indian, who
      still sat rigid as if in prayer. At first sight he seemed motionless, but
      as Father Brown watched him he saw that the man swayed ever so slightly
      with a rhythmic movement, just as the dark tree-tops swayed ever so
      slightly in the wind that was creeping up the dim garden paths and
      shuffling the fallen leaves a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscape was growing rapidly dark, as if for a storm, but they could
      still see all the figures in their various places. Atkinson was leaning
      against a tree with a listless face; Quinton&rsquo;s wife was still at her
      window; the doctor had gone strolling round the end of the conservatory;
      they could see his cigar like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp; and the fakir still sat
      rigid and yet rocking, while the trees above him began to rock and almost
      to roar. Storm was certainly coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When that Indian spoke to us,&rdquo; went on Brown in a conversational
      undertone, &ldquo;I had a sort of vision, a vision of him and all his universe.
      Yet he only said the same thing three times. When first he said &lsquo;I want
      nothing,&rsquo; it meant only that he was impenetrable, that Asia does not give
      itself away. Then he said again, &lsquo;I want nothing,&rsquo; and I knew that he
      meant that he was sufficient to himself, like a cosmos, that he needed no
      God, neither admitted any sins. And when he said the third time, &lsquo;I want
      nothing,&rsquo; he said it with blazing eyes. And I knew that he meant literally
      what he said; that nothing was his desire and his home; that he was weary
      for nothing as for wine; that annihilation, the mere destruction of
      everything or anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two drops of rain fell; and for some reason Flambeau started and looked
      up, as if they had stung him. And the same instant the doctor down by the
      end of the conservatory began running towards them, calling out something
      as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came among them like a bombshell the restless Atkinson happened to
      be taking a turn nearer to the house front; and the doctor clutched him by
      the collar in a convulsive grip. &ldquo;Foul play!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;what have you
      been doing to him, you dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest had sprung erect, and had the voice of steel of a soldier in
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fighting,&rdquo; he cried coolly; &ldquo;we are enough to hold anyone we want to.
      What is the matter, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are not right with Quinton,&rdquo; said the doctor, quite white. &ldquo;I
      could just see him through the glass, and I don&rsquo;t like the way he&rsquo;s lying.
      It&rsquo;s not as I left him, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go in to him,&rdquo; said Father Brown shortly. &ldquo;You can leave Mr.
      Atkinson alone. I have had him in sight since we heard Quinton&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stop here and watch him,&rdquo; said Flambeau hurriedly. &ldquo;You go in and
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and the priest flew to the study door, unlocked it, and fell
      into the room. In doing so they nearly fell over the large mahogany table
      in the centre at which the poet usually wrote; for the place was lit only
      by a small fire kept for the invalid. In the middle of this table lay a
      single sheet of paper, evidently left there on purpose. The doctor
      snatched it up, glanced at it, handed it to Father Brown, and crying,
      &ldquo;Good God, look at that!&rdquo; plunged toward the glass room beyond, where the
      terrible tropic flowers still seemed to keep a crimson memory of the
      sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown read the words three times before he put down the paper. The
      words were: &ldquo;I die by my own hand; yet I die murdered!&rdquo; They were in the
      quite inimitable, not to say illegible, handwriting of Leonard Quinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Father Brown, still keeping the paper in his hand, strode towards the
      conservatory, only to meet his medical friend coming back with a face of
      assurance and collapse. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done it,&rdquo; said Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went together through the gorgeous unnatural beauty of cactus and
      azalea and found Leonard Quinton, poet and romancer, with his head hanging
      downward off his ottoman and his red curls sweeping the ground. Into his
      left side was thrust the queer dagger that they had picked up in the
      garden, and his limp hand still rested on the hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the storm had come at one stride, like the night in Coleridge, and
      garden and glass roof were darkened with driving rain. Father Brown seemed
      to be studying the paper more than the corpse; he held it close to his
      eyes; and seemed trying to read it in the twilight. Then he held it up
      against the faint light, and, as he did so, lightning stared at them for
      an instant so white that the paper looked black against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness full of thunder followed, and after the thunder Father Brown&rsquo;s
      voice said out of the dark: &ldquo;Doctor, this paper is the wrong shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Doctor Harris, with a frowning stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t square,&rdquo; answered Brown. &ldquo;It has a sort of edge snipped off at
      the corner. What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the deuce should I know?&rdquo; growled the doctor. &ldquo;Shall we move this
      poor chap, do you think? He&rsquo;s quite dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the priest; &ldquo;we must leave him as he lies and send for the
      police.&rdquo; But he was still scrutinising the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went back through the study he stopped by the table and picked up
      a small pair of nail scissors. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, with a sort of relief, &ldquo;this
      is what he did it with. But yet&mdash;&rdquo; And he knitted his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stop fooling with that scrap of paper,&rdquo; said the doctor emphatically.
      &ldquo;It was a fad of his. He had hundreds of them. He cut all his paper like
      that,&rdquo; as he pointed to a stack of sermon paper still unused on another
      and smaller table. Father Brown went up to it and held up a sheet. It was
      the same irregular shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And here I see the corners that were snipped off.&rdquo;
       And to the indignation of his colleague he began to count them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, with an apologetic smile. &ldquo;Twenty-three
      sheets cut and twenty-two corners cut off them. And as I see you are
      impatient we will rejoin the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is to tell his wife?&rdquo; asked Dr. Harris. &ldquo;Will you go and tell her
      now, while I send a servant for the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said Father Brown indifferently. And he went out to the
      hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here also he found a drama, though of a more grotesque sort. It showed
      nothing less than his big friend Flambeau in an attitude to which he had
      long been unaccustomed, while upon the pathway at the bottom of the steps
      was sprawling with his boots in the air the amiable Atkinson, his
      billycock hat and walking cane sent flying in opposite directions along
      the path. Atkinson had at length wearied of Flambeau&rsquo;s almost paternal
      custody, and had endeavoured to knock him down, which was by no means a
      smooth game to play with the Roi des Apaches, even after that monarch&rsquo;s
      abdication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau was about to leap upon his enemy and secure him once more, when
      the priest patted him easily on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it up with Mr. Atkinson, my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Beg a mutual pardon
      and say &lsquo;Good night.&rsquo; We need not detain him any longer.&rdquo; Then, as
      Atkinson rose somewhat doubtfully and gathered his hat and stick and went
      towards the garden gate, Father Brown said in a more serious voice: &ldquo;Where
      is that Indian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all three (for the doctor had joined them) turned involuntarily
      towards the dim grassy bank amid the tossing trees purple with twilight,
      where they had last seen the brown man swaying in his strange prayers. The
      Indian was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound him,&rdquo; cried the doctor, stamping furiously. &ldquo;Now I know that it
      was that nigger that did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t believe in magic,&rdquo; said Father Brown quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more I did,&rdquo; said the doctor, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;I only know that I
      loathed that yellow devil when I thought he was a sham wizard. And I shall
      loathe him more if I come to think he was a real one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, his having escaped is nothing,&rdquo; said Flambeau. &ldquo;For we could have
      proved nothing and done nothing against him. One hardly goes to the parish
      constable with a story of suicide imposed by witchcraft or
      auto-suggestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Father Brown had made his way into the house, and now went to
      break the news to the wife of the dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came out again he looked a little pale and tragic, but what passed
      between them in that interview was never known, even when all was known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau, who was talking quietly with the doctor, was surprised to see
      his friend reappear so soon at his elbow; but Brown took no notice, and
      merely drew the doctor apart. &ldquo;You have sent for the police, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Harris. &ldquo;They ought to be here in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me a favour?&rdquo; said the priest quietly. &ldquo;The truth is, I make
      a collection of these curious stories, which often contain, as in the case
      of our Hindoo friend, elements which can hardly be put into a police
      report. Now, I want you to write out a report of this case for my private
      use. Yours is a clever trade,&rdquo; he said, looking the doctor gravely and
      steadily in the face. &ldquo;I sometimes think that you know some details of
      this matter which you have not thought fit to mention. Mine is a
      confidential trade like yours, and I will treat anything you write for me
      in strict confidence. But write the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, who had been listening thoughtfully with his head a little on
      one side, looked the priest in the face for an instant, and said: &ldquo;All
      right,&rdquo; and went into the study, closing the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flambeau,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;there is a long seat there under the
      veranda, where we can smoke out of the rain. You are my only friend in the
      world, and I want to talk to you. Or, perhaps, be silent with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They established themselves comfortably in the veranda seat; Father Brown,
      against his common habit, accepted a good cigar and smoked it steadily in
      silence, while the rain shrieked and rattled on the roof of the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;this is a very queer case. A very queer
      case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was,&rdquo; said Flambeau, with something like a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call it queer, and I call it queer,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and yet we mean
      quite opposite things. The modern mind always mixes up two different
      ideas: mystery in the sense of what is marvellous, and mystery in the
      sense of what is complicated. That is half its difficulty about miracles.
      A miracle is startling; but it is simple. It is simple because it is a
      miracle. It is power coming directly from God (or the devil) instead of
      indirectly through nature or human wills. Now, you mean that this business
      is marvellous because it is miraculous, because it is witchcraft worked by
      a wicked Indian. Understand, I do not say that it was not spiritual or
      diabolic. Heaven and hell only know by what surrounding influences strange
      sins come into the lives of men. But for the present my point is this: If
      it was pure magic, as you think, then it is marvellous; but it is not
      mysterious&mdash;that is, it is not complicated. The quality of a miracle
      is mysterious, but its manner is simple. Now, the manner of this business
      has been the reverse of simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storm that had slackened for a little seemed to be swelling again, and
      there came heavy movements as of faint thunder. Father Brown let fall the
      ash of his cigar and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has been in this incident,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a twisted, ugly, complex
      quality that does not belong to the straight bolts either of heaven or
      hell. As one knows the crooked track of a snail, I know the crooked track
      of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white lightning opened its enormous eye in one wink, the sky shut up
      again, and the priest went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all these crooked things, the crookedest was the shape of that piece
      of paper. It was crookeder than the dagger that killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the paper on which Quinton confessed his suicide,&rdquo; said
      Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the paper on which Quinton wrote, &lsquo;I die by my own hand,&rsquo;&rdquo;
       answered Father Brown. &ldquo;The shape of that paper, my friend, was the wrong
      shape; the wrong shape, if ever I have seen it in this wicked world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only had a corner snipped off,&rdquo; said Flambeau, &ldquo;and I understand that
      all Quinton&rsquo;s paper was cut that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very odd way,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and a very bad way, to my taste
      and fancy. Look here, Flambeau, this Quinton&mdash;God receive his soul!&mdash;was
      perhaps a bit of a cur in some ways, but he really was an artist, with the
      pencil as well as the pen. His handwriting, though hard to read, was bold
      and beautiful. I can&rsquo;t prove what I say; I can&rsquo;t prove anything. But I
      tell you with the full force of conviction that he could never have cut
      that mean little piece off a sheet of paper. If he had wanted to cut down
      paper for some purpose of fitting in, or binding up, or what not, he would
      have made quite a different slash with the scissors. Do you remember the
      shape? It was a mean shape. It was a wrong shape. Like this. Don&rsquo;t you
      remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he waved his burning cigar before him in the darkness, making
      irregular squares so rapidly that Flambeau really seemed to see them as
      fiery hieroglyphics upon the darkness&mdash;hieroglyphics such as his
      friend had spoken of, which are undecipherable, yet can have no good
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Flambeau, as the priest put his cigar in his mouth again and
      leaned back, staring at the roof, &ldquo;suppose somebody else did use the
      scissors. Why should somebody else, cutting pieces off his sermon paper,
      make Quinton commit suicide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown was still leaning back and staring at the roof, but he took
      his cigar out of his mouth and said: &ldquo;Quinton never did commit suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau stared at him. &ldquo;Why, confound it all,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;then why did he
      confess to suicide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest leant forward again, settled his elbows on his knees, looked at
      the ground, and said, in a low, distinct voice: &ldquo;He never did confess to
      suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau laid his cigar down. &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the writing was
      forged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;Quinton wrote it all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you are,&rdquo; said the aggravated Flambeau; &ldquo;Quinton wrote, &lsquo;I
      die by my own hand,&rsquo; with his own hand on a plain piece of paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the wrong shape,&rdquo; said the priest calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the shape be damned!&rdquo; cried Flambeau. &ldquo;What has the shape to do with
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were twenty-three snipped papers,&rdquo; resumed Brown unmoved, &ldquo;and only
      twenty-two pieces snipped off. Therefore one of the pieces had been
      destroyed, probably that from the written paper. Does that suggest
      anything to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light dawned on Flambeau&rsquo;s face, and he said: &ldquo;There was something else
      written by Quinton, some other words. &lsquo;They will tell you I die by my own
      hand,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Do not believe that&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hotter, as the children say,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;But the piece was hardly
      half an inch across; there was no room for one word, let alone five. Can
      you think of anything hardly bigger than a comma which the man with hell
      in his heart had to tear away as a testimony against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can think of nothing,&rdquo; said Flambeau at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about quotation marks?&rdquo; said the priest, and flung his cigar far
      into the darkness like a shooting star.
    </p>
    <p>
      All words had left the other man&rsquo;s mouth, and Father Brown said, like one
      going back to fundamentals:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leonard Quinton was a romancer, and was writing an Oriental romance about
      wizardry and hypnotism. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door opened briskly behind them, and the doctor came
      out with his hat on. He put a long envelope into the priest&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the document you wanted,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I must be getting home.
      Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Father Brown, as the doctor walked briskly to the gate.
      He had left the front door open, so that a shaft of gaslight fell upon
      them. In the light of this Brown opened the envelope and read the
      following words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    DEAR FATHER BROWN,&mdash;Vicisti Galilee. Otherwise, damn your
    eyes, which are very penetrating ones. Can it be possible that
    there is something in all that stuff of yours after all?
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    I am a man who has ever since boyhood believed in Nature and
    in all natural functions and instincts, whether men called them
    moral or immoral. Long before I became a doctor, when I was a
    schoolboy keeping mice and spiders, I believed that to be a good
    animal is the best thing in the world. But just now I am shaken;
    I have believed in Nature; but it seems as if Nature could betray
    a man. Can there be anything in your bosh? I am really getting
    morbid.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    I loved Quinton&rsquo;s wife. What was there wrong in that? Nature
    told me to, and it&rsquo;s love that makes the world go round. I also
    thought quite sincerely that she would be happier with a clean
    animal like me than with that tormenting little lunatic. What was
    there wrong in that? I was only facing facts, like a man of
    science. She would have been happier.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    According to my own creed I was quite free to kill Quinton,
    which was the best thing for everybody, even himself. But as a
    healthy animal I had no notion of killing myself. I resolved,
    therefore, that I would never do it until I saw a chance that
    would leave me scot free. I saw that chance this morning.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    I have been three times, all told, into Quinton&rsquo;s study today.
    The first time I went in he would talk about nothing but the weird
    tale, called &ldquo;The Cure of a Saint,&rdquo; which he was writing, which
    was all about how some Indian hermit made an English colonel kill
    himself by thinking about him. He showed me the last sheets, and
    even read me the last paragraph, which was something like this:
    &ldquo;The conqueror of the Punjab, a mere yellow skeleton, but still
    gigantic, managed to lift himself on his elbow and gasp in his
    nephew&rsquo;s ear: &lsquo;I die by my own hand, yet I die murdered!&rsquo;&rdquo; It so
    happened by one chance out of a hundred, that those last words
    were written at the top of a new sheet of paper. I left the room,
    and went out into the garden intoxicated with a frightful
    opportunity.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    We walked round the house; and two more things happened in my
    favour. You suspected an Indian, and you found a dagger which the
    Indian might most probably use. Taking the opportunity to stuff
    it in my pocket I went back to Quinton&rsquo;s study, locked the door,
    and gave him his sleeping draught. He was against answering
    Atkinson at all, but I urged him to call out and quiet the fellow,
    because I wanted a clear proof that Quinton was alive when I left
    the room for the second time. Quinton lay down in the conservatory,
    and I came through the study. I am a quick man with my hands, and
    in a minute and a half I had done what I wanted to do. I had
    emptied all the first part of Quinton&rsquo;s romance into the fireplace,
    where it burnt to ashes. Then I saw that the quotation marks
    wouldn&rsquo;t do, so I snipped them off, and to make it seem likelier,
    snipped the whole quire to match. Then I came out with the
    knowledge that Quinton&rsquo;s confession of suicide lay on the front
    table, while Quinton lay alive but asleep in the conservatory
    beyond.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    The last act was a desperate one; you can guess it: I pretended
    to have seen Quinton dead and rushed to his room. I delayed you
    with the paper, and, being a quick man with my hands, killed
    Quinton while you were looking at his confession of suicide. He
    was half-asleep, being drugged, and I put his own hand on the
    knife and drove it into his body. The knife was of so queer a
    shape that no one but an operator could have calculated the angle
    that would reach his heart. I wonder if you noticed this.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    When I had done it, the extraordinary thing happened. Nature
    deserted me. I felt ill. I felt just as if I had done something
    wrong. I think my brain is breaking up; I feel some sort of
    desperate pleasure in thinking I have told the thing to somebody;
    that I shall not have to be alone with it if I marry and have
    children. What is the matter with me?... Madness... or can one
    have remorse, just as if one were in Byron&rsquo;s poems! I cannot
    write any more.

                   James Erskine Harris.
</pre>
    <p>
      Father Brown carefully folded up the letter, and put it in his breast
      pocket just as there came a loud peal at the gate bell, and the wet
      waterproofs of several policemen gleamed in the road outside.

    <h2>
      The Sins of Prince Saradine
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Flambeau took his month&rsquo;s holiday from his office in Westminster he
      took it in a small sailing-boat, so small that it passed much of its time
      as a rowing-boat. He took it, moreover, in little rivers in the Eastern
      counties, rivers so small that the boat looked like a magic boat, sailing
      on land through meadows and cornfields. The vessel was just comfortable
      for two people; there was room only for necessities, and Flambeau had
      stocked it with such things as his special philosophy considered
      necessary. They reduced themselves, apparently, to four essentials: tins
      of salmon, if he should want to eat; loaded revolvers, if he should want
      to fight; a bottle of brandy, presumably in case he should faint; and a
      priest, presumably in case he should die. With this light luggage he
      crawled down the little Norfolk rivers, intending to reach the Broads at
      last, but meanwhile delighting in the overhanging gardens and meadows, the
      mirrored mansions or villages, lingering to fish in the pools and corners,
      and in some sense hugging the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a true philosopher, Flambeau had no aim in his holiday; but, like a
      true philosopher, he had an excuse. He had a sort of half purpose, which
      he took just so seriously that its success would crown the holiday, but
      just so lightly that its failure would not spoil it. Years ago, when he
      had been a king of thieves and the most famous figure in Paris, he had
      often received wild communications of approval, denunciation, or even
      love; but one had, somehow, stuck in his memory. It consisted simply of a
      visiting-card, in an envelope with an English postmark. On the back of the
      card was written in French and in green ink: &ldquo;If you ever retire and
      become respectable, come and see me. I want to meet you, for I have met
      all the other great men of my time. That trick of yours of getting one
      detective to arrest the other was the most splendid scene in French
      history.&rdquo; On the front of the card was engraved in the formal fashion,
      &ldquo;Prince Saradine, Reed House, Reed Island, Norfolk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not troubled much about the prince then, beyond ascertaining that
      he had been a brilliant and fashionable figure in southern Italy. In his
      youth, it was said, he had eloped with a married woman of high rank; the
      escapade was scarcely startling in his social world, but it had clung to
      men&rsquo;s minds because of an additional tragedy: the alleged suicide of the
      insulted husband, who appeared to have flung himself over a precipice in
      Sicily. The prince then lived in Vienna for a time, but his more recent
      years seemed to have been passed in perpetual and restless travel. But
      when Flambeau, like the prince himself, had left European celebrity and
      settled in England, it occurred to him that he might pay a surprise visit
      to this eminent exile in the Norfolk Broads. Whether he should find the
      place he had no idea; and, indeed, it was sufficiently small and
      forgotten. But, as things fell out, he found it much sooner than he
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had moored their boat one night under a bank veiled in high grasses
      and short pollarded trees. Sleep, after heavy sculling, had come to them
      early, and by a corresponding accident they awoke before it was light. To
      speak more strictly, they awoke before it was daylight; for a large lemon
      moon was only just setting in the forest of high grass above their heads,
      and the sky was of a vivid violet-blue, nocturnal but bright. Both men had
      simultaneously a reminiscence of childhood, of the elfin and adventurous
      time when tall weeds close over us like woods. Standing up thus against
      the large low moon, the daisies really seemed to be giant daisies, the
      dandelions to be giant dandelions. Somehow it reminded them of the dado of
      a nursery wall-paper. The drop of the river-bed sufficed to sink them
      under the roots of all shrubs and flowers and make them gaze upwards at
      the grass. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Flambeau, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like being in fairyland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown sat bolt upright in the boat and crossed himself. His
      movement was so abrupt that his friend asked him, with a mild stare, what
      was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people who wrote the mediaeval ballads,&rdquo; answered the priest, &ldquo;knew
      more about fairies than you do. It isn&rsquo;t only nice things that happen in
      fairyland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo; said Flambeau. &ldquo;Only nice things could happen under such an
      innocent moon. I am for pushing on now and seeing what does really come.
      We may die and rot before we ever see again such a moon or such a mood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;I never said it was always wrong to enter
      fairyland. I only said it was always dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pushed slowly up the brightening river; the glowing violet of the sky
      and the pale gold of the moon grew fainter and fainter, and faded into
      that vast colourless cosmos that precedes the colours of the dawn. When
      the first faint stripes of red and gold and grey split the horizon from
      end to end they were broken by the black bulk of a town or village which
      sat on the river just ahead of them. It was already an easy twilight, in
      which all things were visible, when they came under the hanging roofs and
      bridges of this riverside hamlet. The houses, with their long, low,
      stooping roofs, seemed to come down to drink at the river, like huge grey
      and red cattle. The broadening and whitening dawn had already turned to
      working daylight before they saw any living creature on the wharves and
      bridges of that silent town. Eventually they saw a very placid and
      prosperous man in his shirt sleeves, with a face as round as the recently
      sunken moon, and rays of red whisker around the low arc of it, who was
      leaning on a post above the sluggish tide. By an impulse not to be
      analysed, Flambeau rose to his full height in the swaying boat and shouted
      at the man to ask if he knew Reed Island or Reed House. The prosperous
      man&rsquo;s smile grew slightly more expansive, and he simply pointed up the
      river towards the next bend of it. Flambeau went ahead without further
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat took many such grassy corners and followed many such reedy and
      silent reaches of river; but before the search had become monotonous they
      had swung round a specially sharp angle and come into the silence of a
      sort of pool or lake, the sight of which instinctively arrested them. For
      in the middle of this wider piece of water, fringed on every side with
      rushes, lay a long, low islet, along which ran a long, low house or
      bungalow built of bamboo or some kind of tough tropic cane. The upstanding
      rods of bamboo which made the walls were pale yellow, the sloping rods
      that made the roof were of darker red or brown, otherwise the long house
      was a thing of repetition and monotony. The early morning breeze rustled
      the reeds round the island and sang in the strange ribbed house as in a
      giant pan-pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; cried Flambeau; &ldquo;here is the place, after all! Here is Reed
      Island, if ever there was one. Here is Reed House, if it is anywhere. I
      believe that fat man with whiskers was a fairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; remarked Father Brown impartially. &ldquo;If he was, he was a bad
      fairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even as he spoke the impetuous Flambeau had run his boat ashore in the
      rattling reeds, and they stood in the long, quaint islet beside the odd
      and silent house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house stood with its back, as it were, to the river and the only
      landing-stage; the main entrance was on the other side, and looked down
      the long island garden. The visitors approached it, therefore, by a small
      path running round nearly three sides of the house, close under the low
      eaves. Through three different windows on three different sides they
      looked in on the same long, well-lit room, panelled in light wood, with a
      large number of looking-glasses, and laid out as for an elegant lunch. The
      front door, when they came round to it at last, was flanked by two
      turquoise-blue flower pots. It was opened by a butler of the drearier type&mdash;long,
      lean, grey and listless&mdash;who murmured that Prince Saradine was from
      home at present, but was expected hourly; the house being kept ready for
      him and his guests. The exhibition of the card with the scrawl of green
      ink awoke a flicker of life in the parchment face of the depressed
      retainer, and it was with a certain shaky courtesy that he suggested that
      the strangers should remain. &ldquo;His Highness may be here any minute,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and would be distressed to have just missed any gentleman he had
      invited. We have orders always to keep a little cold lunch for him and his
      friends, and I am sure he would wish it to be offered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moved with curiosity to this minor adventure, Flambeau assented
      gracefully, and followed the old man, who ushered him ceremoniously into
      the long, lightly panelled room. There was nothing very notable about it,
      except the rather unusual alternation of many long, low windows with many
      long, low oblongs of looking-glass, which gave a singular air of lightness
      and unsubstantialness to the place. It was somehow like lunching out of
      doors. One or two pictures of a quiet kind hung in the corners, one a
      large grey photograph of a very young man in uniform, another a red chalk
      sketch of two long-haired boys. Asked by Flambeau whether the soldierly
      person was the prince, the butler answered shortly in the negative; it was
      the prince&rsquo;s younger brother, Captain Stephen Saradine, he said. And with
      that the old man seemed to dry up suddenly and lose all taste for
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch had tailed off with exquisite coffee and liqueurs, the guests
      were introduced to the garden, the library, and the housekeeper&mdash;a
      dark, handsome lady, of no little majesty, and rather like a plutonic
      Madonna. It appeared that she and the butler were the only survivors of
      the prince&rsquo;s original foreign menage the other servants now in the house
      being new and collected in Norfolk by the housekeeper. This latter lady
      went by the name of Mrs. Anthony, but she spoke with a slight Italian
      accent, and Flambeau did not doubt that Anthony was a Norfolk version of
      some more Latin name. Mr. Paul, the butler, also had a faintly foreign
      air, but he was in tongue and training English, as are many of the most
      polished men-servants of the cosmopolitan nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty and unique as it was, the place had about it a curious luminous
      sadness. Hours passed in it like days. The long, well-windowed rooms were
      full of daylight, but it seemed a dead daylight. And through all other
      incidental noises, the sound of talk, the clink of glasses, or the passing
      feet of servants, they could hear on all sides of the house the melancholy
      noise of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have taken a wrong turning, and come to a wrong place,&rdquo; said Father
      Brown, looking out of the window at the grey-green sedges and the silver
      flood. &ldquo;Never mind; one can sometimes do good by being the right person in
      the wrong place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown, though commonly a silent, was an oddly sympathetic little
      man, and in those few but endless hours he unconsciously sank deeper into
      the secrets of Reed House than his professional friend. He had that knack
      of friendly silence which is so essential to gossip; and saying scarcely a
      word, he probably obtained from his new acquaintances all that in any case
      they would have told. The butler indeed was naturally uncommunicative. He
      betrayed a sullen and almost animal affection for his master; who, he
      said, had been very badly treated. The chief offender seemed to be his
      highness&rsquo;s brother, whose name alone would lengthen the old man&rsquo;s lantern
      jaws and pucker his parrot nose into a sneer. Captain Stephen was a
      ne&rsquo;er-do-well, apparently, and had drained his benevolent brother of
      hundreds and thousands; forced him to fly from fashionable life and live
      quietly in this retreat. That was all Paul, the butler, would say, and
      Paul was obviously a partisan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian housekeeper was somewhat more communicative, being, as Brown
      fancied, somewhat less content. Her tone about her master was faintly
      acid; though not without a certain awe. Flambeau and his friend were
      standing in the room of the looking-glasses examining the red sketch of
      the two boys, when the housekeeper swept in swiftly on some domestic
      errand. It was a peculiarity of this glittering, glass-panelled place that
      anyone entering was reflected in four or five mirrors at once; and Father
      Brown, without turning round, stopped in the middle of a sentence of
      family criticism. But Flambeau, who had his face close up to the picture,
      was already saying in a loud voice, &ldquo;The brothers Saradine, I suppose.
      They both look innocent enough. It would be hard to say which is the good
      brother and which the bad.&rdquo; Then, realising the lady&rsquo;s presence, he turned
      the conversation with some triviality, and strolled out into the garden.
      But Father Brown still gazed steadily at the red crayon sketch; and Mrs.
      Anthony still gazed steadily at Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had large and tragic brown eyes, and her olive face glowed darkly with
      a curious and painful wonder&mdash;as of one doubtful of a stranger&rsquo;s
      identity or purpose. Whether the little priest&rsquo;s coat and creed touched
      some southern memories of confession, or whether she fancied he knew more
      than he did, she said to him in a low voice as to a fellow plotter, &ldquo;He is
      right enough in one way, your friend. He says it would be hard to pick out
      the good and bad brothers. Oh, it would be hard, it would be mighty hard,
      to pick out the good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Father Brown, and began to move away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman took a step nearer to him, with thunderous brows and a sort of
      savage stoop, like a bull lowering his horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a good one,&rdquo; she hissed. &ldquo;There was badness enough in the
      captain taking all that money, but I don&rsquo;t think there was much goodness
      in the prince giving it. The captain&rsquo;s not the only one with something
      against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light dawned on the cleric&rsquo;s averted face, and his mouth formed silently
      the word &ldquo;blackmail.&rdquo; Even as he did so the woman turned an abrupt white
      face over her shoulder and almost fell. The door had opened soundlessly
      and the pale Paul stood like a ghost in the doorway. By the weird trick of
      the reflecting walls, it seemed as if five Pauls had entered by five doors
      simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Highness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has just arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the same flash the figure of a man had passed outside the first window,
      crossing the sunlit pane like a lighted stage. An instant later he passed
      at the second window and the many mirrors repainted in successive frames
      the same eagle profile and marching figure. He was erect and alert, but
      his hair was white and his complexion of an odd ivory yellow. He had that
      short, curved Roman nose which generally goes with long, lean cheeks and
      chin, but these were partly masked by moustache and imperial. The
      moustache was much darker than the beard, giving an effect slightly
      theatrical, and he was dressed up to the same dashing part, having a white
      top hat, an orchid in his coat, a yellow waistcoat and yellow gloves which
      he flapped and swung as he walked. When he came round to the front door
      they heard the stiff Paul open it, and heard the new arrival say
      cheerfully, &ldquo;Well, you see I have come.&rdquo; The stiff Mr. Paul bowed and
      answered in his inaudible manner; for a few minutes their conversation
      could not be heard. Then the butler said, &ldquo;Everything is at your
      disposal;&rdquo; and the glove-flapping Prince Saradine came gaily into the room
      to greet them. They beheld once more that spectral scene&mdash;five
      princes entering a room with five doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince put the white hat and yellow gloves on the table and offered
      his hand quite cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to see you here, Mr. Flambeau,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Knowing you very well
      by reputation, if that&rsquo;s not an indiscreet remark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; answered Flambeau, laughing. &ldquo;I am not sensitive. Very few
      reputations are gained by unsullied virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince flashed a sharp look at him to see if the retort had any
      personal point; then he laughed also and offered chairs to everyone,
      including himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant little place, this, I think,&rdquo; he said with a detached air. &ldquo;Not
      much to do, I fear; but the fishing is really good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, who was staring at him with the grave stare of a baby, was
      haunted by some fancy that escaped definition. He looked at the grey,
      carefully curled hair, yellow white visage, and slim, somewhat foppish
      figure. These were not unnatural, though perhaps a shade prononcé, like
      the outfit of a figure behind the footlights. The nameless interest lay in
      something else, in the very framework of the face; Brown was tormented
      with a half memory of having seen it somewhere before. The man looked like
      some old friend of his dressed up. Then he suddenly remembered the
      mirrors, and put his fancy down to some psychological effect of that
      multiplication of human masks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Saradine distributed his social attentions between his guests with
      great gaiety and tact. Finding the detective of a sporting turn and eager
      to employ his holiday, he guided Flambeau and Flambeau&rsquo;s boat down to the
      best fishing spot in the stream, and was back in his own canoe in twenty
      minutes to join Father Brown in the library and plunge equally politely
      into the priest&rsquo;s more philosophic pleasures. He seemed to know a great
      deal both about the fishing and the books, though of these not the most
      edifying; he spoke five or six languages, though chiefly the slang of
      each. He had evidently lived in varied cities and very motley societies,
      for some of his cheerfullest stories were about gambling hells and opium
      dens, Australian bushrangers or Italian brigands. Father Brown knew that
      the once-celebrated Saradine had spent his last few years in almost
      ceaseless travel, but he had not guessed that the travels were so
      disreputable or so amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, with all his dignity of a man of the world, Prince Saradine
      radiated to such sensitive observers as the priest, a certain atmosphere
      of the restless and even the unreliable. His face was fastidious, but his
      eye was wild; he had little nervous tricks, like a man shaken by drink or
      drugs, and he neither had, nor professed to have, his hand on the helm of
      household affairs. All these were left to the two old servants, especially
      to the butler, who was plainly the central pillar of the house. Mr. Paul,
      indeed, was not so much a butler as a sort of steward or, even,
      chamberlain; he dined privately, but with almost as much pomp as his
      master; he was feared by all the servants; and he consulted with the
      prince decorously, but somewhat unbendingly&mdash;rather as if he were the
      prince&rsquo;s solicitor. The sombre housekeeper was a mere shadow in
      comparison; indeed, she seemed to efface herself and wait only on the
      butler, and Brown heard no more of those volcanic whispers which had half
      told him of the younger brother who blackmailed the elder. Whether the
      prince was really being thus bled by the absent captain, he could not be
      certain, but there was something insecure and secretive about Saradine
      that made the tale by no means incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they went once more into the long hall with the windows and the
      mirrors, yellow evening was dropping over the waters and the willowy
      banks; and a bittern sounded in the distance like an elf upon his dwarfish
      drum. The same singular sentiment of some sad and evil fairyland crossed
      the priest&rsquo;s mind again like a little grey cloud. &ldquo;I wish Flambeau were
      back,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in doom?&rdquo; asked the restless Prince Saradine suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered his guest. &ldquo;I believe in Doomsday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince turned from the window and stared at him in a singular manner,
      his face in shadow against the sunset. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that we here are on the wrong side of the tapestry,&rdquo; answered
      Father Brown. &ldquo;The things that happen here do not seem to mean anything;
      they mean something somewhere else. Somewhere else retribution will come
      on the real offender. Here it often seems to fall on the wrong person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince made an inexplicable noise like an animal; in his shadowed face
      the eyes were shining queerly. A new and shrewd thought exploded silently
      in the other&rsquo;s mind. Was there another meaning in Saradine&rsquo;s blend of
      brilliancy and abruptness? Was the prince&mdash;Was he perfectly sane? He
      was repeating, &ldquo;The wrong person&mdash;the wrong person,&rdquo; many more times
      than was natural in a social exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Father Brown awoke tardily to a second truth. In the mirrors before
      him he could see the silent door standing open, and the silent Mr. Paul
      standing in it, with his usual pallid impassiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it better to announce at once,&rdquo; he said, with the same stiff
      respectfulness as of an old family lawyer, &ldquo;a boat rowed by six men has
      come to the landing-stage, and there&rsquo;s a gentleman sitting in the stern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boat!&rdquo; repeated the prince; &ldquo;a gentleman?&rdquo; and he rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a startled silence punctuated only by the odd noise of the bird
      in the sedge; and then, before anyone could speak again, a new face and
      figure passed in profile round the three sunlit windows, as the prince had
      passed an hour or two before. But except for the accident that both
      outlines were aquiline, they had little in common. Instead of the new
      white topper of Saradine, was a black one of antiquated or foreign shape;
      under it was a young and very solemn face, clean shaven, blue about its
      resolute chin, and carrying a faint suggestion of the young Napoleon. The
      association was assisted by something old and odd about the whole get-up,
      as of a man who had never troubled to change the fashions of his fathers.
      He had a shabby blue frock coat, a red, soldierly looking waistcoat, and a
      kind of coarse white trousers common among the early Victorians, but
      strangely incongruous today. From all this old clothes-shop his olive face
      stood out strangely young and monstrously sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; said Prince Saradine, and clapping on his white hat he went
      to the front door himself, flinging it open on the sunset garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that time the new-comer and his followers were drawn up on the lawn
      like a small stage army. The six boatmen had pulled the boat well up on
      shore, and were guarding it almost menacingly, holding their oars erect
      like spears. They were swarthy men, and some of them wore earrings. But
      one of them stood forward beside the olive-faced young man in the red
      waistcoat, and carried a large black case of unfamiliar form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;is Saradine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saradine assented rather negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer had dull, dog-like brown eyes, as different as possible from
      the restless and glittering grey eyes of the prince. But once again Father
      Brown was tortured with a sense of having seen somewhere a replica of the
      face; and once again he remembered the repetitions of the glass-panelled
      room, and put down the coincidence to that. &ldquo;Confound this crystal
      palace!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;One sees everything too many times. It&rsquo;s like a
      dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are Prince Saradine,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I may tell you that my
      name is Antonelli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antonelli,&rdquo; repeated the prince languidly. &ldquo;Somehow I remember the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to present myself,&rdquo; said the young Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his left hand he politely took off his old-fashioned top-hat; with
      his right he caught Prince Saradine so ringing a crack across the face
      that the white top hat rolled down the steps and one of the blue
      flower-pots rocked upon its pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, whatever he was, was evidently not a coward; he sprang at his
      enemy&rsquo;s throat and almost bore him backwards to the grass. But his enemy
      extricated himself with a singularly inappropriate air of hurried
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; he said, panting and in halting English. &ldquo;I have
      insulted. I will give satisfaction. Marco, open the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man beside him with the earrings and the big black case proceeded to
      unlock it. He took out of it two long Italian rapiers, with splendid steel
      hilts and blades, which he planted point downwards in the lawn. The
      strange young man standing facing the entrance with his yellow and
      vindictive face, the two swords standing up in the turf like two crosses
      in a cemetery, and the line of the ranked towers behind, gave it all an
      odd appearance of being some barbaric court of justice. But everything
      else was unchanged, so sudden had been the interruption. The sunset gold
      still glowed on the lawn, and the bittern still boomed as announcing some
      small but dreadful destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Saradine,&rdquo; said the man called Antonelli, &ldquo;when I was an infant in
      the cradle you killed my father and stole my mother; my father was the
      more fortunate. You did not kill him fairly, as I am going to kill you.
      You and my wicked mother took him driving to a lonely pass in Sicily,
      flung him down a cliff, and went on your way. I could imitate you if I
      chose, but imitating you is too vile. I have followed you all over the
      world, and you have always fled from me. But this is the end of the world&mdash;and
      of you. I have you now, and I give you the chance you never gave my
      father. Choose one of those swords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Saradine, with contracted brows, seemed to hesitate a moment, but
      his ears were still singing with the blow, and he sprang forward and
      snatched at one of the hilts. Father Brown had also sprung forward,
      striving to compose the dispute; but he soon found his personal presence
      made matters worse. Saradine was a French freemason and a fierce atheist,
      and a priest moved him by the law of contraries. And for the other man
      neither priest nor layman moved him at all. This young man with the
      Bonaparte face and the brown eyes was something far sterner than a puritan&mdash;a
      pagan. He was a simple slayer from the morning of the earth; a man of the
      stone age&mdash;a man of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hope remained, the summoning of the household; and Father Brown ran
      back into the house. He found, however, that all the under servants had
      been given a holiday ashore by the autocrat Paul, and that only the sombre
      Mrs. Anthony moved uneasily about the long rooms. But the moment she
      turned a ghastly face upon him, he resolved one of the riddles of the
      house of mirrors. The heavy brown eyes of Antonelli were the heavy brown
      eyes of Mrs. Anthony; and in a flash he saw half the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son is outside,&rdquo; he said without wasting words; &ldquo;either he or the
      prince will be killed. Where is Mr. Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is at the landing-stage,&rdquo; said the woman faintly. &ldquo;He is&mdash;he is&mdash;signalling
      for help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Anthony,&rdquo; said Father Brown seriously, &ldquo;there is no time for
      nonsense. My friend has his boat down the river fishing. Your son&rsquo;s boat
      is guarded by your son&rsquo;s men. There is only this one canoe; what is Mr.
      Paul doing with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Santa Maria! I do not know,&rdquo; she said; and swooned all her length on the
      matted floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown lifted her to a sofa, flung a pot of water over her, shouted
      for help, and then rushed down to the landing-stage of the little island.
      But the canoe was already in mid-stream, and old Paul was pulling and
      pushing it up the river with an energy incredible at his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will save my master,&rdquo; he cried, his eyes blazing maniacally. &ldquo;I will
      save him yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown could do nothing but gaze after the boat as it struggled
      up-stream and pray that the old man might waken the little town in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A duel is bad enough,&rdquo; he muttered, rubbing up his rough dust-coloured
      hair, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s something wrong about this duel, even as a duel. I feel
      it in my bones. But what can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he stood staring at the water, a wavering mirror of sunset, he heard
      from the other end of the island garden a small but unmistakable sound&mdash;the
      cold concussion of steel. He turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away on the farthest cape or headland of the long islet, on a strip of
      turf beyond the last rank of roses, the duellists had already crossed
      swords. Evening above them was a dome of virgin gold, and, distant as they
      were, every detail was picked out. They had cast off their coats, but the
      yellow waistcoat and white hair of Saradine, the red waistcoat and white
      trousers of Antonelli, glittered in the level light like the colours of
      the dancing clockwork dolls. The two swords sparkled from point to pommel
      like two diamond pins. There was something frightful in the two figures
      appearing so little and so gay. They looked like two butterflies trying to
      pin each other to a cork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown ran as hard as he could, his little legs going like a wheel.
      But when he came to the field of combat he found he was born too late and
      too early&mdash;too late to stop the strife, under the shadow of the grim
      Sicilians leaning on their oars, and too early to anticipate any
      disastrous issue of it. For the two men were singularly well matched, the
      prince using his skill with a sort of cynical confidence, the Sicilian
      using his with a murderous care. Few finer fencing matches can ever have
      been seen in crowded amphitheatres than that which tinkled and sparkled on
      that forgotten island in the reedy river. The dizzy fight was balanced so
      long that hope began to revive in the protesting priest; by all common
      probability Paul must soon come back with the police. It would be some
      comfort even if Flambeau came back from his fishing, for Flambeau,
      physically speaking, was worth four other men. But there was no sign of
      Flambeau, and, what was much queerer, no sign of Paul or the police. No
      other raft or stick was left to float on; in that lost island in that vast
      nameless pool, they were cut off as on a rock in the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as he had the thought the ringing of the rapiers quickened to a
      rattle, the prince&rsquo;s arms flew up, and the point shot out behind between
      his shoulder-blades. He went over with a great whirling movement, almost
      like one throwing the half of a boy&rsquo;s cart-wheel. The sword flew from his
      hand like a shooting star, and dived into the distant river. And he
      himself sank with so earth-shaking a subsidence that he broke a big
      rose-tree with his body and shook up into the sky a cloud of red earth&mdash;like
      the smoke of some heathen sacrifice. The Sicilian had made blood-offering
      to the ghost of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was instantly on his knees by the corpse; but only to make too
      sure that it was a corpse. As he was still trying some last hopeless tests
      he heard for the first time voices from farther up the river, and saw a
      police boat shoot up to the landing-stage, with constables and other
      important people, including the excited Paul. The little priest rose with
      a distinctly dubious grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why on earth,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;why on earth couldn&rsquo;t he have come
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some seven minutes later the island was occupied by an invasion of
      townsfolk and police, and the latter had put their hands on the victorious
      duellist, ritually reminding him that anything he said might be used
      against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not say anything,&rdquo; said the monomaniac, with a wonderful and
      peaceful face. &ldquo;I shall never say anything more. I am very happy, and I
      only want to be hanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he shut his mouth as they led him away, and it is the strange but
      certain truth that he never opened it again in this world, except to say
      &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; at his trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown had stared at the suddenly crowded garden, the arrest of the
      man of blood, the carrying away of the corpse after its examination by the
      doctor, rather as one watches the break-up of some ugly dream; he was
      motionless, like a man in a nightmare. He gave his name and address as a
      witness, but declined their offer of a boat to the shore, and remained
      alone in the island garden, gazing at the broken rose bush and the whole
      green theatre of that swift and inexplicable tragedy. The light died along
      the river; mist rose in the marshy banks; a few belated birds flitted
      fitfully across.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stuck stubbornly in his sub-consciousness (which was an unusually lively
      one) was an unspeakable certainty that there was something still
      unexplained. This sense that had clung to him all day could not be fully
      explained by his fancy about &ldquo;looking-glass land.&rdquo; Somehow he had not seen
      the real story, but some game or masque. And yet people do not get hanged
      or run through the body for the sake of a charade.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat on the steps of the landing-stage ruminating he grew conscious
      of the tall, dark streak of a sail coming silently down the shining river,
      and sprang to his feet with such a backrush of feeling that he almost
      wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flambeau!&rdquo; he cried, and shook his friend by both hands again and again,
      much to the astonishment of that sportsman, as he came on shore with his
      fishing tackle. &ldquo;Flambeau,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re not killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed!&rdquo; repeated the angler in great astonishment. &ldquo;And why should I be
      killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because nearly everybody else is,&rdquo; said his companion rather wildly.
      &ldquo;Saradine got murdered, and Antonelli wants to be hanged, and his mother&rsquo;s
      fainted, and I, for one, don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m in this world or the next.
      But, thank God, you&rsquo;re in the same one.&rdquo; And he took the bewildered
      Flambeau&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they turned from the landing-stage they came under the eaves of the low
      bamboo house, and looked in through one of the windows, as they had done
      on their first arrival. They beheld a lamp-lit interior well calculated to
      arrest their eyes. The table in the long dining-room had been laid for
      dinner when Saradine&rsquo;s destroyer had fallen like a stormbolt on the
      island. And the dinner was now in placid progress, for Mrs. Anthony sat
      somewhat sullenly at the foot of the table, while at the head of it was
      Mr. Paul, the major domo, eating and drinking of the best, his bleared,
      bluish eyes standing queerly out of his face, his gaunt countenance
      inscrutable, but by no means devoid of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of powerful impatience, Flambeau rattled at the window,
      wrenched it open, and put an indignant head into the lamp-lit room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can understand you may need some refreshment, but
      really to steal your master&rsquo;s dinner while he lies murdered in the garden&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have stolen a great many things in a long and pleasant life,&rdquo; replied
      the strange old gentleman placidly; &ldquo;this dinner is one of the few things
      I have not stolen. This dinner and this house and garden happen to belong
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thought flashed across Flambeau&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You mean to say,&rdquo; he began,
      &ldquo;that the will of Prince Saradine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Prince Saradine,&rdquo; said the old man, munching a salted almond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown, who was looking at the birds outside, jumped as if he were
      shot, and put in at the window a pale face like a turnip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are what?&rdquo; he repeated in a shrill voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul, Prince Saradine, A vos ordres,&rdquo; said the venerable person politely,
      lifting a glass of sherry. &ldquo;I live here very quietly, being a domestic
      kind of fellow; and for the sake of modesty I am called Mr. Paul, to
      distinguish me from my unfortunate brother Mr. Stephen. He died, I hear,
      recently&mdash;in the garden. Of course, it is not my fault if enemies
      pursue him to this place. It is owing to the regrettable irregularity of
      his life. He was not a domestic character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He relapsed into silence, and continued to gaze at the opposite wall just
      above the bowed and sombre head of the woman. They saw plainly the family
      likeness that had haunted them in the dead man. Then his old shoulders
      began to heave and shake a little, as if he were choking, but his face did
      not alter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Flambeau after a pause, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s laughing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; said Father Brown, who was quite white. &ldquo;Come away from this
      house of hell. Let us get into an honest boat again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Night had sunk on rushes and river by the time they had pushed off from
      the island, and they went down-stream in the dark, warming themselves with
      two big cigars that glowed like crimson ships&rsquo; lanterns. Father Brown took
      his cigar out of his mouth and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you can guess the whole story now? After all, it&rsquo;s a primitive
      story. A man had two enemies. He was a wise man. And so he discovered that
      two enemies are better than one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not follow that,&rdquo; answered Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s really simple,&rdquo; rejoined his friend. &ldquo;Simple, though anything
      but innocent. Both the Saradines were scamps, but the prince, the elder,
      was the sort of scamp that gets to the top, and the younger, the captain,
      was the sort that sinks to the bottom. This squalid officer fell from
      beggar to blackmailer, and one ugly day he got his hold upon his brother,
      the prince. Obviously it was for no light matter, for Prince Paul Saradine
      was frankly &lsquo;fast,&rsquo; and had no reputation to lose as to the mere sins of
      society. In plain fact, it was a hanging matter, and Stephen literally had
      a rope round his brother&rsquo;s neck. He had somehow discovered the truth about
      the Sicilian affair, and could prove that Paul murdered old Antonelli in
      the mountains. The captain raked in the hush money heavily for ten years,
      until even the prince&rsquo;s splendid fortune began to look a little foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Prince Saradine bore another burden besides his blood-sucking
      brother. He knew that the son of Antonelli, a mere child at the time of
      the murder, had been trained in savage Sicilian loyalty, and lived only to
      avenge his father, not with the gibbet (for he lacked Stephen&rsquo;s legal
      proof), but with the old weapons of vendetta. The boy had practised arms
      with a deadly perfection, and about the time that he was old enough to use
      them Prince Saradine began, as the society papers said, to travel. The
      fact is that he began to flee for his life, passing from place to place
      like a hunted criminal; but with one relentless man upon his trail. That
      was Prince Paul&rsquo;s position, and by no means a pretty one. The more money
      he spent on eluding Antonelli the less he had to silence Stephen. The more
      he gave to silence Stephen the less chance there was of finally escaping
      Antonelli. Then it was that he showed himself a great man&mdash;a genius
      like Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of resisting his two antagonists, he surrendered suddenly to both
      of them. He gave way like a Japanese wrestler, and his foes fell prostrate
      before him. He gave up the race round the world, and he gave up his
      address to young Antonelli; then he gave up everything to his brother. He
      sent Stephen money enough for smart clothes and easy travel, with a letter
      saying roughly: &lsquo;This is all I have left. You have cleaned me out. I still
      have a little house in Norfolk, with servants and a cellar, and if you
      want more from me you must take that. Come and take possession if you
      like, and I will live there quietly as your friend or agent or anything.&rsquo; 
      He knew that the Sicilian had never seen the Saradine brothers save,
      perhaps, in pictures; he knew they were somewhat alike, both having grey,
      pointed beards. Then he shaved his own face and waited. The trap worked.
      The unhappy captain, in his new clothes, entered the house in triumph as a
      prince, and walked upon the Sicilian&rsquo;s sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one hitch, and it is to the honour of human nature. Evil
      spirits like Saradine often blunder by never expecting the virtues of
      mankind. He took it for granted that the Italian&rsquo;s blow, when it came,
      would be dark, violent and nameless, like the blow it avenged; that the
      victim would be knifed at night, or shot from behind a hedge, and so die
      without speech. It was a bad minute for Prince Paul when Antonelli&rsquo;s
      chivalry proposed a formal duel, with all its possible explanations. It
      was then that I found him putting off in his boat with wild eyes. He was
      fleeing, bareheaded, in an open boat before Antonelli should learn who he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, however agitated, he was not hopeless. He knew the adventurer and he
      knew the fanatic. It was quite probable that Stephen, the adventurer,
      would hold his tongue, through his mere histrionic pleasure in playing a
      part, his lust for clinging to his new cosy quarters, his rascal&rsquo;s trust
      in luck, and his fine fencing. It was certain that Antonelli, the fanatic,
      would hold his tongue, and be hanged without telling tales of his family.
      Paul hung about on the river till he knew the fight was over. Then he
      roused the town, brought the police, saw his two vanquished enemies taken
      away forever, and sat down smiling to his dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laughing, God help us!&rdquo; said Flambeau with a strong shudder. &ldquo;Do they get
      such ideas from Satan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got that idea from you,&rdquo; answered the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; ejaculated Flambeau. &ldquo;From me! What do you mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest pulled a visiting-card from his pocket and held it up in the
      faint glow of his cigar; it was scrawled with green ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember his original invitation to you?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and the
      compliment to your criminal exploit? &lsquo;That trick of yours,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;of
      getting one detective to arrest the other&rsquo;? He has just copied your trick.
      With an enemy on each side of him, he slipped swiftly out of the way and
      let them collide and kill each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau tore Prince Saradine&rsquo;s card from the priest&rsquo;s hands and rent it
      savagely in small pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the last of that old skull and crossbones,&rdquo; he said as he
      scattered the pieces upon the dark and disappearing waves of the stream;
      &ldquo;but I should think it would poison the fishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last gleam of white card and green ink was drowned and darkened; a
      faint and vibrant colour as of morning changed the sky, and the moon
      behind the grasses grew paler. They drifted in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Flambeau suddenly, &ldquo;do you think it was all a dream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest shook his head, whether in dissent or agnosticism, but remained
      mute. A smell of hawthorn and of orchards came to them through the
      darkness, telling them that a wind was awake; the next moment it swayed
      their little boat and swelled their sail, and carried them onward down the
      winding river to happier places and the homes of harmless men.

    <h2>
      The Hammer of God
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little village of Bohun Beacon was perched on a hill so steep that the
      tall spire of its church seemed only like the peak of a small mountain. At
      the foot of the church stood a smithy, generally red with fires and always
      littered with hammers and scraps of iron; opposite to this, over a rude
      cross of cobbled paths, was &ldquo;The Blue Boar,&rdquo; the only inn of the place. It
      was upon this crossway, in the lifting of a leaden and silver daybreak,
      that two brothers met in the street and spoke; though one was beginning
      the day and the other finishing it. The Rev. and Hon. Wilfred Bohun was
      very devout, and was making his way to some austere exercises of prayer or
      contemplation at dawn. Colonel the Hon. Norman Bohun, his elder brother,
      was by no means devout, and was sitting in evening dress on the bench
      outside &ldquo;The Blue Boar,&rdquo; drinking what the philosophic observer was free
      to regard either as his last glass on Tuesday or his first on Wednesday.
      The colonel was not particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bohuns were one of the very few aristocratic families really dating
      from the Middle Ages, and their pennon had actually seen Palestine. But it
      is a great mistake to suppose that such houses stand high in chivalric
      tradition. Few except the poor preserve traditions. Aristocrats live not
      in traditions but in fashions. The Bohuns had been Mohocks under Queen
      Anne and Mashers under Queen Victoria. But like more than one of the
      really ancient houses, they had rotted in the last two centuries into mere
      drunkards and dandy degenerates, till there had even come a whisper of
      insanity. Certainly there was something hardly human about the colonel&rsquo;s
      wolfish pursuit of pleasure, and his chronic resolution not to go home
      till morning had a touch of the hideous clarity of insomnia. He was a
      tall, fine animal, elderly, but with hair still startlingly yellow. He
      would have looked merely blonde and leonine, but his blue eyes were sunk
      so deep in his face that they looked black. They were a little too close
      together. He had very long yellow moustaches; on each side of them a fold
      or furrow from nostril to jaw, so that a sneer seemed cut into his face.
      Over his evening clothes he wore a curious pale yellow coat that looked
      more like a very light dressing gown than an overcoat, and on the back of
      his head was stuck an extraordinary broad-brimmed hat of a bright green
      colour, evidently some oriental curiosity caught up at random. He was
      proud of appearing in such incongruous attires&mdash;proud of the fact
      that he always made them look congruous.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother the curate had also the yellow hair and the elegance, but he
      was buttoned up to the chin in black, and his face was clean-shaven,
      cultivated, and a little nervous. He seemed to live for nothing but his
      religion; but there were some who said (notably the blacksmith, who was a
      Presbyterian) that it was a love of Gothic architecture rather than of
      God, and that his haunting of the church like a ghost was only another and
      purer turn of the almost morbid thirst for beauty which sent his brother
      raging after women and wine. This charge was doubtful, while the man&rsquo;s
      practical piety was indubitable. Indeed, the charge was mostly an ignorant
      misunderstanding of the love of solitude and secret prayer, and was
      founded on his being often found kneeling, not before the altar, but in
      peculiar places, in the crypts or gallery, or even in the belfry. He was
      at the moment about to enter the church through the yard of the smithy,
      but stopped and frowned a little as he saw his brother&rsquo;s cavernous eyes
      staring in the same direction. On the hypothesis that the colonel was
      interested in the church he did not waste any speculations. There only
      remained the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, and though the blacksmith was a Puritan
      and none of his people, Wilfred Bohun had heard some scandals about a
      beautiful and rather celebrated wife. He flung a suspicious look across
      the shed, and the colonel stood up laughing to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Wilfred,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Like a good landlord I am watching
      sleeplessly over my people. I am going to call on the blacksmith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred looked at the ground, and said: &ldquo;The blacksmith is out. He is over
      at Greenford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered the other with silent laughter; &ldquo;that is why I am
      calling on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norman,&rdquo; said the cleric, with his eye on a pebble in the road, &ldquo;are you
      ever afraid of thunderbolts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the colonel. &ldquo;Is your hobby meteorology?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Wilfred, without looking up, &ldquo;do you ever think that God
      might strike you in the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the colonel; &ldquo;I see your hobby is folk-lore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your hobby is blasphemy,&rdquo; retorted the religious man, stung in the
      one live place of his nature. &ldquo;But if you do not fear God, you have good
      reason to fear man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder raised his eyebrows politely. &ldquo;Fear man?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barnes the blacksmith is the biggest and strongest man for forty miles
      round,&rdquo; said the clergyman sternly. &ldquo;I know you are no coward or weakling,
      but he could throw you over the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This struck home, being true, and the lowering line by mouth and nostril
      darkened and deepened. For a moment he stood with the heavy sneer on his
      face. But in an instant Colonel Bohun had recovered his own cruel good
      humour and laughed, showing two dog-like front teeth under his yellow
      moustache. &ldquo;In that case, my dear Wilfred,&rdquo; he said quite carelessly, &ldquo;it
      was wise for the last of the Bohuns to come out partially in armour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he took off the queer round hat covered with green, showing that it
      was lined within with steel. Wilfred recognised it indeed as a light
      Japanese or Chinese helmet torn down from a trophy that hung in the old
      family hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the first hat to hand,&rdquo; explained his brother airily; &ldquo;always the
      nearest hat&mdash;and the nearest woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blacksmith is away at Greenford,&rdquo; said Wilfred quietly; &ldquo;the time of
      his return is unsettled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that he turned and went into the church with bowed head, crossing
      himself like one who wishes to be quit of an unclean spirit. He was
      anxious to forget such grossness in the cool twilight of his tall Gothic
      cloisters; but on that morning it was fated that his still round of
      religious exercises should be everywhere arrested by small shocks. As he
      entered the church, hitherto always empty at that hour, a kneeling figure
      rose hastily to its feet and came towards the full daylight of the
      doorway. When the curate saw it he stood still with surprise. For the
      early worshipper was none other than the village idiot, a nephew of the
      blacksmith, one who neither would nor could care for the church or for
      anything else. He was always called &ldquo;Mad Joe,&rdquo; and seemed to have no other
      name; he was a dark, strong, slouching lad, with a heavy white face, dark
      straight hair, and a mouth always open. As he passed the priest, his
      moon-calf countenance gave no hint of what he had been doing or thinking
      of. He had never been known to pray before. What sort of prayers was he
      saying now? Extraordinary prayers surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Bohun stood rooted to the spot long enough to see the idiot go out
      into the sunshine, and even to see his dissolute brother hail him with a
      sort of avuncular jocularity. The last thing he saw was the colonel
      throwing pennies at the open mouth of Joe, with the serious appearance of
      trying to hit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ugly sunlit picture of the stupidity and cruelty of the earth sent
      the ascetic finally to his prayers for purification and new thoughts. He
      went up to a pew in the gallery, which brought him under a coloured window
      which he loved and always quieted his spirit; a blue window with an angel
      carrying lilies. There he began to think less about the half-wit, with his
      livid face and mouth like a fish. He began to think less of his evil
      brother, pacing like a lean lion in his horrible hunger. He sank deeper
      and deeper into those cold and sweet colours of silver blossoms and
      sapphire sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this place half an hour afterwards he was found by Gibbs, the village
      cobbler, who had been sent for him in some haste. He got to his feet with
      promptitude, for he knew that no small matter would have brought Gibbs
      into such a place at all. The cobbler was, as in many villages, an
      atheist, and his appearance in church was a shade more extraordinary than
      Mad Joe&rsquo;s. It was a morning of theological enigmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Wilfred Bohun rather stiffly, but putting out a
      trembling hand for his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atheist spoke in a tone that, coming from him, was quite startlingly
      respectful, and even, as it were, huskily sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;but we didn&rsquo;t
      think it right not to let you know at once. I&rsquo;m afraid a rather dreadful
      thing has happened, sir. I&rsquo;m afraid your brother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred clenched his frail hands. &ldquo;What devilry has he done now?&rdquo; he cried
      in voluntary passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said the cobbler, coughing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s done nothing, and
      won&rsquo;t do anything. I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s done for. You had really better come
      down, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curate followed the cobbler down a short winding stair which brought
      them out at an entrance rather higher than the street. Bohun saw the
      tragedy in one glance, flat underneath him like a plan. In the yard of the
      smithy were standing five or six men mostly in black, one in an
      inspector&rsquo;s uniform. They included the doctor, the Presbyterian minister,
      and the priest from the Roman Catholic chapel, to which the blacksmith&rsquo;s
      wife belonged. The latter was speaking to her, indeed, very rapidly, in an
      undertone, as she, a magnificent woman with red-gold hair, was sobbing
      blindly on a bench. Between these two groups, and just clear of the main
      heap of hammers, lay a man in evening dress, spread-eagled and flat on his
      face. From the height above Wilfred could have sworn to every item of his
      costume and appearance, down to the Bohun rings upon his fingers; but the
      skull was only a hideous splash, like a star of blackness and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Bohun gave but one glance, and ran down the steps into the yard.
      The doctor, who was the family physician, saluted him, but he scarcely
      took any notice. He could only stammer out: &ldquo;My brother is dead. What does
      it mean? What is this horrible mystery?&rdquo; There was an unhappy silence; and
      then the cobbler, the most outspoken man present, answered: &ldquo;Plenty of
      horror, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but not much mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Wilfred, with a white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; answered Gibbs. &ldquo;There is only one man for forty
      miles round that could have struck such a blow as that, and he&rsquo;s the man
      that had most reason to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not prejudge anything,&rdquo; put in the doctor, a tall, black-bearded
      man, rather nervously; &ldquo;but it is competent for me to corroborate what Mr.
      Gibbs says about the nature of the blow, sir; it is an incredible blow.
      Mr. Gibbs says that only one man in this district could have done it. I
      should have said myself that nobody could have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder of superstition went through the slight figure of the curate. &ldquo;I
      can hardly understand,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bohun,&rdquo; said the doctor in a low voice, &ldquo;metaphors literally fail me.
      It is inadequate to say that the skull was smashed to bits like an
      eggshell. Fragments of bone were driven into the body and the ground like
      bullets into a mud wall. It was the hand of a giant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a moment, looking grimly through his glasses; then he added:
      &ldquo;The thing has one advantage&mdash;that it clears most people of suspicion
      at one stroke. If you or I or any normally made man in the country were
      accused of this crime, we should be acquitted as an infant would be
      acquitted of stealing the Nelson column.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; repeated the cobbler obstinately; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one
      man that could have done it, and he&rsquo;s the man that would have done it.
      Where&rsquo;s Simeon Barnes, the blacksmith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s over at Greenford,&rdquo; faltered the curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More likely over in France,&rdquo; muttered the cobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is in neither of those places,&rdquo; said a small and colourless voice,
      which came from the little Roman priest who had joined the group. &ldquo;As a
      matter of fact, he is coming up the road at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little priest was not an interesting man to look at, having stubbly
      brown hair and a round and stolid face. But if he had been as splendid as
      Apollo no one would have looked at him at that moment. Everyone turned
      round and peered at the pathway which wound across the plain below, along
      which was indeed walking, at his own huge stride and with a hammer on his
      shoulder, Simeon the smith. He was a bony and gigantic man, with deep,
      dark, sinister eyes and a dark chin beard. He was walking and talking
      quietly with two other men; and though he was never specially cheerful, he
      seemed quite at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried the atheistic cobbler, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s the hammer he did it
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the inspector, a sensible-looking man with a sandy moustache,
      speaking for the first time. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the hammer he did it with over there
      by the church wall. We have left it and the body exactly as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All glanced round and the short priest went across and looked down in
      silence at the tool where it lay. It was one of the smallest and the
      lightest of the hammers, and would not have caught the eye among the rest;
      but on the iron edge of it were blood and yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence the short priest spoke without looking up, and there was a
      new note in his dull voice. &ldquo;Mr. Gibbs was hardly right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in
      saying that there is no mystery. There is at least the mystery of why so
      big a man should attempt so big a blow with so little a hammer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind that,&rdquo; cried Gibbs, in a fever. &ldquo;What are we to do with
      Simeon Barnes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him alone,&rdquo; said the priest quietly. &ldquo;He is coming here of himself.
      I know those two men with him. They are very good fellows from Greenford,
      and they have come over about the Presbyterian chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke the tall smith swung round the corner of the church, and
      strode into his own yard. Then he stood there quite still, and the hammer
      fell from his hand. The inspector, who had preserved impenetrable
      propriety, immediately went up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you, Mr. Barnes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether you know anything about
      what has happened here. You are not bound to say. I hope you don&rsquo;t know,
      and that you will be able to prove it. But I must go through the form of
      arresting you in the King&rsquo;s name for the murder of Colonel Norman Bohun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not bound to say anything,&rdquo; said the cobbler in officious
      excitement. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to prove everything. They haven&rsquo;t proved yet that
      it is Colonel Bohun, with the head all smashed up like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t wash,&rdquo; said the doctor aside to the priest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of the
      detective stories. I was the colonel&rsquo;s medical man, and I knew his body
      better than he did. He had very fine hands, but quite peculiar ones. The
      second and third fingers were the same length. Oh, that&rsquo;s the colonel
      right enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he glanced at the brained corpse upon the ground the iron eyes of the
      motionless blacksmith followed them and rested there also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Colonel Bohun dead?&rdquo; said the smith quite calmly. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s damned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything! Oh, don&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; cried the atheist cobbler,
      dancing about in an ecstasy of admiration of the English legal system. For
      no man is such a legalist as the good Secularist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith turned on him over his shoulder the august face of a
      fanatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well for you infidels to dodge like foxes because the world&rsquo;s law
      favours you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but God guards His own in His pocket, as you shall
      see this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he pointed to the colonel and said: &ldquo;When did this dog die in his
      sins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moderate your language,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moderate the Bible&rsquo;s language, and I&rsquo;ll moderate mine. When did he die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him alive at six o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; stammered Wilfred Bohun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God is good,&rdquo; said the smith. &ldquo;Mr. Inspector, I have not the slightest
      objection to being arrested. It is you who may object to arresting me. I
      don&rsquo;t mind leaving the court without a stain on my character. You do mind
      perhaps leaving the court with a bad set-back in your career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The solid inspector for the first time looked at the blacksmith with a
      lively eye; as did everybody else, except the short, strange priest, who
      was still looking down at the little hammer that had dealt the dreadful
      blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two men standing outside this shop,&rdquo; went on the blacksmith
      with ponderous lucidity, &ldquo;good tradesmen in Greenford whom you all know,
      who will swear that they saw me from before midnight till daybreak and
      long after in the committee room of our Revival Mission, which sits all
      night, we save souls so fast. In Greenford itself twenty people could
      swear to me for all that time. If I were a heathen, Mr. Inspector, I would
      let you walk on to your downfall. But as a Christian man I feel bound to
      give you your chance, and ask you whether you will hear my alibi now or in
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inspector seemed for the first time disturbed, and said, &ldquo;Of course I
      should be glad to clear you altogether now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smith walked out of his yard with the same long and easy stride, and
      returned to his two friends from Greenford, who were indeed friends of
      nearly everyone present. Each of them said a few words which no one ever
      thought of disbelieving. When they had spoken, the innocence of Simeon
      stood up as solid as the great church above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those silences struck the group which are more strange and
      insufferable than any speech. Madly, in order to make conversation, the
      curate said to the Catholic priest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem very much interested in that hammer, Father Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Father Brown; &ldquo;why is it such a small hammer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor swung round on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;who would use a little hammer with
      ten larger hammers lying about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he lowered his voice in the curate&rsquo;s ear and said: &ldquo;Only the kind of
      person that can&rsquo;t lift a large hammer. It is not a question of force or
      courage between the sexes. It&rsquo;s a question of lifting power in the
      shoulders. A bold woman could commit ten murders with a light hammer and
      never turn a hair. She could not kill a beetle with a heavy one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Bohun was staring at him with a sort of hypnotised horror, while
      Father Brown listened with his head a little on one side, really
      interested and attentive. The doctor went on with more hissing emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do these idiots always assume that the only person who hates the
      wife&rsquo;s lover is the wife&rsquo;s husband? Nine times out of ten the person who
      most hates the wife&rsquo;s lover is the wife. Who knows what insolence or
      treachery he had shown her&mdash;look there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a momentary gesture towards the red-haired woman on the bench. She
      had lifted her head at last and the tears were drying on her splendid
      face. But the eyes were fixed on the corpse with an electric glare that
      had in it something of idiocy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Wilfred Bohun made a limp gesture as if waving away all desire to
      know; but Father Brown, dusting off his sleeve some ashes blown from the
      furnace, spoke in his indifferent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like so many doctors,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your mental science is really
      suggestive. It is your physical science that is utterly impossible. I
      agree that the woman wants to kill the co-respondent much more than the
      petitioner does. And I agree that a woman will always pick up a small
      hammer instead of a big one. But the difficulty is one of physical
      impossibility. No woman ever born could have smashed a man&rsquo;s skull out
      flat like that.&rdquo; Then he added reflectively, after a pause: &ldquo;These people
      haven&rsquo;t grasped the whole of it. The man was actually wearing an iron
      helmet, and the blow scattered it like broken glass. Look at that woman.
      Look at her arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence held them all up again, and then the doctor said rather sulkily:
      &ldquo;Well, I may be wrong; there are objections to everything. But I stick to
      the main point. No man but an idiot would pick up that little hammer if he
      could use a big hammer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the lean and quivering hands of Wilfred Bohun went up to his
      head and seemed to clutch his scanty yellow hair. After an instant they
      dropped, and he cried: &ldquo;That was the word I wanted; you have said the
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he continued, mastering his discomposure: &ldquo;The words you said were,
      &lsquo;No man but an idiot would pick up the small hammer.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;no man but an idiot did.&rdquo; The rest stared at him
      with eyes arrested and riveted, and he went on in a febrile and feminine
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a priest,&rdquo; he cried unsteadily, &ldquo;and a priest should be no shedder
      of blood. I&mdash;I mean that he should bring no one to the gallows. And I
      thank God that I see the criminal clearly now&mdash;because he is a
      criminal who cannot be brought to the gallows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not denounce him?&rdquo; inquired the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not be hanged if I did denounce him,&rdquo; answered Wilfred with a
      wild but curiously happy smile. &ldquo;When I went into the church this morning
      I found a madman praying there&mdash;that poor Joe, who has been wrong all
      his life. God knows what he prayed; but with such strange folk it is not
      incredible to suppose that their prayers are all upside down. Very likely
      a lunatic would pray before killing a man. When I last saw poor Joe he was
      with my brother. My brother was mocking him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried the doctor, &ldquo;this is talking at last. But how do you
      explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Wilfred was almost trembling with the excitement of his own
      glimpse of the truth. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see; don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he cried feverishly;
      &ldquo;that is the only theory that covers both the queer things, that answers
      both the riddles. The two riddles are the little hammer and the big blow.
      The smith might have struck the big blow, but would not have chosen the
      little hammer. His wife would have chosen the little hammer, but she could
      not have struck the big blow. But the madman might have done both. As for
      the little hammer&mdash;why, he was mad and might have picked up anything.
      And for the big blow, have you never heard, doctor, that a maniac in his
      paroxysm may have the strength of ten men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor drew a deep breath and then said, &ldquo;By golly, I believe you&rsquo;ve
      got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown had fixed his eyes on the speaker so long and steadily as to
      prove that his large grey, ox-like eyes were not quite so insignificant as
      the rest of his face. When silence had fallen he said with marked respect:
      &ldquo;Mr. Bohun, yours is the only theory yet propounded which holds water
      every way and is essentially unassailable. I think, therefore, that you
      deserve to be told, on my positive knowledge, that it is not the true
      one.&rdquo; And with that the old little man walked away and stared again at the
      hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow seems to know more than he ought to,&rdquo; whispered the doctor
      peevishly to Wilfred. &ldquo;Those popish priests are deucedly sly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Bohun, with a sort of wild fatigue. &ldquo;It was the lunatic. It
      was the lunatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The group of the two clerics and the doctor had fallen away from the more
      official group containing the inspector and the man he had arrested. Now,
      however, that their own party had broken up, they heard voices from the
      others. The priest looked up quietly and then looked down again as he
      heard the blacksmith say in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ve convinced you, Mr. Inspector. I&rsquo;m a strong man, as you say,
      but I couldn&rsquo;t have flung my hammer bang here from Greenford. My hammer
      hasn&rsquo;t got wings that it should come flying half a mile over hedges and
      fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inspector laughed amicably and said: &ldquo;No, I think you can be
      considered out of it, though it&rsquo;s one of the rummiest coincidences I ever
      saw. I can only ask you to give us all the assistance you can in finding a
      man as big and strong as yourself. By George! you might be useful, if only
      to hold him! I suppose you yourself have no guess at the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have a guess,&rdquo; said the pale smith, &ldquo;but it is not at a man.&rdquo; Then,
      seeing the scared eyes turn towards his wife on the bench, he put his huge
      hand on her shoulder and said: &ldquo;Nor a woman either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the inspector jocularly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think cows
      use hammers, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think no thing of flesh held that hammer,&rdquo; said the blacksmith in a
      stifled voice; &ldquo;mortally speaking, I think the man died alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred made a sudden forward movement and peered at him with burning
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, Barnes,&rdquo; came the sharp voice of the cobbler, &ldquo;that
      the hammer jumped up of itself and knocked the man down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you gentlemen may stare and snigger,&rdquo; cried Simeon; &ldquo;you clergymen
      who tell us on Sunday in what a stillness the Lord smote Sennacherib. I
      believe that One who walks invisible in every house defended the honour of
      mine, and laid the defiler dead before the door of it. I believe the force
      in that blow was just the force there is in earthquakes, and no force
      less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred said, with a voice utterly undescribable: &ldquo;I told Norman myself to
      beware of the thunderbolt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That agent is outside my jurisdiction,&rdquo; said the inspector with a slight
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not outside His,&rdquo; answered the smith; &ldquo;see you to it,&rdquo; and,
      turning his broad back, he went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaken Wilfred was led away by Father Brown, who had an easy and
      friendly way with him. &ldquo;Let us get out of this horrid place, Mr. Bohun,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;May I look inside your church? I hear it&rsquo;s one of the oldest in
      England. We take some interest, you know,&rdquo; he added with a comical
      grimace, &ldquo;in old English churches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Bohun did not smile, for humour was never his strong point. But he
      nodded rather eagerly, being only too ready to explain the Gothic
      splendours to someone more likely to be sympathetic than the Presbyterian
      blacksmith or the atheist cobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let us go in at this side.&rdquo; And he led the way
      into the high side entrance at the top of the flight of steps. Father
      Brown was mounting the first step to follow him when he felt a hand on his
      shoulder, and turned to behold the dark, thin figure of the doctor, his
      face darker yet with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the physician harshly, &ldquo;you appear to know some secrets in
      this black business. May I ask if you are going to keep them to yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, doctor,&rdquo; answered the priest, smiling quite pleasantly, &ldquo;there is
      one very good reason why a man of my trade should keep things to himself
      when he is not sure of them, and that is that it is so constantly his duty
      to keep them to himself when he is sure of them. But if you think I have
      been discourteously reticent with you or anyone, I will go to the extreme
      limit of my custom. I will give you two very large hints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; said the doctor gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Father Brown quietly, &ldquo;the thing is quite in your own
      province. It is a matter of physical science. The blacksmith is mistaken,
      not perhaps in saying that the blow was divine, but certainly in saying
      that it came by a miracle. It was no miracle, doctor, except in so far as
      man is himself a miracle, with his strange and wicked and yet half-heroic
      heart. The force that smashed that skull was a force well known to
      scientists&mdash;one of the most frequently debated of the laws of
      nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, who was looking at him with frowning intentness, only said:
      &ldquo;And the other hint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other hint is this,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Do you remember the
      blacksmith, though he believes in miracles, talking scornfully of the
      impossible fairy tale that his hammer had wings and flew half a mile
      across country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; added Father Brown, with a broad smile, &ldquo;that fairy tale was the
      nearest thing to the real truth that has been said today.&rdquo; And with that
      he turned his back and stumped up the steps after the curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Wilfred, who had been waiting for him, pale and impatient, as
      if this little delay were the last straw for his nerves, led him
      immediately to his favourite corner of the church, that part of the
      gallery closest to the carved roof and lit by the wonderful window with
      the angel. The little Latin priest explored and admired everything
      exhaustively, talking cheerfully but in a low voice all the time. When in
      the course of his investigation he found the side exit and the winding
      stair down which Wilfred had rushed to find his brother dead, Father Brown
      ran not down but up, with the agility of a monkey, and his clear voice
      came from an outer platform above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up here, Mr. Bohun,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;The air will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bohun followed him, and came out on a kind of stone gallery or balcony
      outside the building, from which one could see the illimitable plain in
      which their small hill stood, wooded away to the purple horizon and dotted
      with villages and farms. Clear and square, but quite small beneath them,
      was the blacksmith&rsquo;s yard, where the inspector still stood taking notes
      and the corpse still lay like a smashed fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might be the map of the world, mightn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bohun very gravely, and nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately beneath and about them the lines of the Gothic building
      plunged outwards into the void with a sickening swiftness akin to suicide.
      There is that element of Titan energy in the architecture of the Middle
      Ages that, from whatever aspect it be seen, it always seems to be rushing
      away, like the strong back of some maddened horse. This church was hewn
      out of ancient and silent stone, bearded with old fungoids and stained
      with the nests of birds. And yet, when they saw it from below, it sprang
      like a fountain at the stars; and when they saw it, as now, from above, it
      poured like a cataract into a voiceless pit. For these two men on the
      tower were left alone with the most terrible aspect of Gothic; the
      monstrous foreshortening and disproportion, the dizzy perspectives, the
      glimpses of great things small and small things great; a topsy-turvydom of
      stone in the mid-air. Details of stone, enormous by their proximity, were
      relieved against a pattern of fields and farms, pygmy in their distance. A
      carved bird or beast at a corner seemed like some vast walking or flying
      dragon wasting the pastures and villages below. The whole atmosphere was
      dizzy and dangerous, as if men were upheld in air amid the gyrating wings
      of colossal genii; and the whole of that old church, as tall and rich as a
      cathedral, seemed to sit upon the sunlit country like a cloudburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is something rather dangerous about standing on these high
      places even to pray,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;Heights were made to be looked
      at, not to be looked from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that one may fall over,&rdquo; asked Wilfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that one&rsquo;s soul may fall if one&rsquo;s body doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely understand you,&rdquo; remarked Bohun indistinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that blacksmith, for instance,&rdquo; went on Father Brown calmly; &ldquo;a
      good man, but not a Christian&mdash;hard, imperious, unforgiving. Well,
      his Scotch religion was made up by men who prayed on hills and high crags,
      and learnt to look down on the world more than to look up at heaven.
      Humility is the mother of giants. One sees great things from the valley;
      only small things from the peak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Bohun tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other in an odd voice; &ldquo;we know he didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he resumed, looking tranquilly out over the plain with his
      pale grey eyes. &ldquo;I knew a man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who began by worshipping with
      others before the altar, but who grew fond of high and lonely places to
      pray from, corners or niches in the belfry or the spire. And once in one
      of those dizzy places, where the whole world seemed to turn under him like
      a wheel, his brain turned also, and he fancied he was God. So that, though
      he was a good man, he committed a great crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred&rsquo;s face was turned away, but his bony hands turned blue and white
      as they tightened on the parapet of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought it was given to him to judge the world and strike down the
      sinner. He would never have had such a thought if he had been kneeling
      with other men upon a floor. But he saw all men walking about like
      insects. He saw one especially strutting just below him, insolent and
      evident by a bright green hat&mdash;a poisonous insect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rooks cawed round the corners of the belfry; but there was no other sound
      till Father Brown went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This also tempted him, that he had in his hand one of the most awful
      engines of nature; I mean gravitation, that mad and quickening rush by
      which all earth&rsquo;s creatures fly back to her heart when released. See, the
      inspector is strutting just below us in the smithy. If I were to toss a
      pebble over this parapet it would be something like a bullet by the time
      it struck him. If I were to drop a hammer&mdash;even a small hammer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred Bohun threw one leg over the parapet, and Father Brown had him in
      a minute by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by that door,&rdquo; he said quite gently; &ldquo;that door leads to hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bohun staggered back against the wall, and stared at him with frightful
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Are you a devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a man,&rdquo; answered Father Brown gravely; &ldquo;and therefore have all
      devils in my heart. Listen to me,&rdquo; he said after a short pause. &ldquo;I know
      what you did&mdash;at least, I can guess the great part of it. When you
      left your brother you were racked with no unrighteous rage, to the extent
      even that you snatched up a small hammer, half inclined to kill him with
      his foulness on his mouth. Recoiling, you thrust it under your buttoned
      coat instead, and rushed into the church. You pray wildly in many places,
      under the angel window, upon the platform above, and a higher platform
      still, from which you could see the colonel&rsquo;s Eastern hat like the back of
      a green beetle crawling about. Then something snapped in your soul, and
      you let God&rsquo;s thunderbolt fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilfred put a weak hand to his head, and asked in a low voice: &ldquo;How did
      you know that his hat looked like a green beetle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; said the other with the shadow of a smile, &ldquo;that was common
      sense. But hear me further. I say I know all this; but no one else shall
      know it. The next step is for you; I shall take no more steps; I will seal
      this with the seal of confession. If you ask me why, there are many
      reasons, and only one that concerns you. I leave things to you because you
      have not yet gone very far wrong, as assassins go. You did not help to fix
      the crime on the smith when it was easy; or on his wife, when that was
      easy. You tried to fix it on the imbecile because you knew that he could
      not suffer. That was one of the gleams that it is my business to find in
      assassins. And now come down into the village, and go your own way as free
      as the wind; for I have said my last word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went down the winding stairs in utter silence, and came out into the
      sunlight by the smithy. Wilfred Bohun carefully unlatched the wooden gate
      of the yard, and going up to the inspector, said: &ldquo;I wish to give myself
      up; I have killed my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      The Eye of Apollo
    </h2>
    <p>
      That singular smoky sparkle, at once a confusion and a transparency, which
      is the strange secret of the Thames, was changing more and more from its
      grey to its glittering extreme as the sun climbed to the zenith over
      Westminster, and two men crossed Westminster Bridge. One man was very tall
      and the other very short; they might even have been fantastically compared
      to the arrogant clock-tower of Parliament and the humbler humped shoulders
      of the Abbey, for the short man was in clerical dress. The official
      description of the tall man was M. Hercule Flambeau, private detective,
      and he was going to his new offices in a new pile of flats facing the
      Abbey entrance. The official description of the short man was the Reverend
      J. Brown, attached to St. Francis Xavier&rsquo;s Church, Camberwell, and he was
      coming from a Camberwell deathbed to see the new offices of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building was American in its sky-scraping altitude, and American also
      in the oiled elaboration of its machinery of telephones and lifts. But it
      was barely finished and still understaffed; only three tenants had moved
      in; the office just above Flambeau was occupied, as also was the office
      just below him; the two floors above that and the three floors below were
      entirely bare. But the first glance at the new tower of flats caught
      something much more arresting. Save for a few relics of scaffolding, the
      one glaring object was erected outside the office just above Flambeau&rsquo;s.
      It was an enormous gilt effigy of the human eye, surrounded with rays of
      gold, and taking up as much room as two or three of the office windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is that?&rdquo; asked Father Brown, and stood still. &ldquo;Oh, a new
      religion,&rdquo; said Flambeau, laughing; &ldquo;one of those new religions that
      forgive your sins by saying you never had any. Rather like Christian
      Science, I should think. The fact is that a fellow calling himself Kalon
      (I don&rsquo;t know what his name is, except that it can&rsquo;t be that) has taken
      the flat just above me. I have two lady typewriters underneath me, and
      this enthusiastic old humbug on top. He calls himself the New Priest of
      Apollo, and he worships the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him look out,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;The sun was the cruellest of all
      the gods. But what does that monstrous eye mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I understand it, it is a theory of theirs,&rdquo; answered Flambeau, &ldquo;that a
      man can endure anything if his mind is quite steady. Their two great
      symbols are the sun and the open eye; for they say that if a man were
      really healthy he could stare at the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a man were really healthy,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;he would not bother to
      stare at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all I can tell you about the new religion,&rdquo; went on Flambeau
      carelessly. &ldquo;It claims, of course, that it can cure all physical
      diseases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it cure the one spiritual disease?&rdquo; asked Father Brown, with a
      serious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the one spiritual disease?&rdquo; asked Flambeau, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thinking one is quite well,&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau was more interested in the quiet little office below him than in
      the flamboyant temple above. He was a lucid Southerner, incapable of
      conceiving himself as anything but a Catholic or an atheist; and new
      religions of a bright and pallid sort were not much in his line. But
      humanity was always in his line, especially when it was good-looking;
      moreover, the ladies downstairs were characters in their way. The office
      was kept by two sisters, both slight and dark, one of them tall and
      striking. She had a dark, eager and aquiline profile, and was one of those
      women whom one always thinks of in profile, as of the clean-cut edge of
      some weapon. She seemed to cleave her way through life. She had eyes of
      startling brilliancy, but it was the brilliancy of steel rather than of
      diamonds; and her straight, slim figure was a shade too stiff for its
      grace. Her younger sister was like her shortened shadow, a little greyer,
      paler, and more insignificant. They both wore a business-like black, with
      little masculine cuffs and collars. There are thousands of such curt,
      strenuous ladies in the offices of London, but the interest of these lay
      rather in their real than their apparent position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Pauline Stacey, the elder, was actually the heiress of a crest and
      half a county, as well as great wealth; she had been brought up in castles
      and gardens, before a frigid fierceness (peculiar to the modern woman) had
      driven her to what she considered a harsher and a higher existence. She
      had not, indeed, surrendered her money; in that there would have been a
      romantic or monkish abandon quite alien to her masterful utilitarianism.
      She held her wealth, she would say, for use upon practical social objects.
      Part of it she had put into her business, the nucleus of a model
      typewriting emporium; part of it was distributed in various leagues and
      causes for the advancement of such work among women. How far Joan, her
      sister and partner, shared this slightly prosaic idealism no one could be
      very sure. But she followed her leader with a dog-like affection which was
      somehow more attractive, with its touch of tragedy, than the hard, high
      spirits of the elder. For Pauline Stacey had nothing to say to tragedy;
      she was understood to deny its existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her rigid rapidity and cold impatience had amused Flambeau very much on
      the first occasion of his entering the flats. He had lingered outside the
      lift in the entrance hall waiting for the lift-boy, who generally conducts
      strangers to the various floors. But this bright-eyed falcon of a girl had
      openly refused to endure such official delay. She said sharply that she
      knew all about the lift, and was not dependent on boys&mdash;or men
      either. Though her flat was only three floors above, she managed in the
      few seconds of ascent to give Flambeau a great many of her fundamental
      views in an off-hand manner; they were to the general effect that she was
      a modern working woman and loved modern working machinery. Her bright
      black eyes blazed with abstract anger against those who rebuke mechanic
      science and ask for the return of romance. Everyone, she said, ought to be
      able to manage machines, just as she could manage the lift. She seemed
      almost to resent the fact of Flambeau opening the lift-door for her; and
      that gentleman went up to his own apartments smiling with somewhat mingled
      feelings at the memory of such spit-fire self-dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She certainly had a temper, of a snappy, practical sort; the gestures of
      her thin, elegant hands were abrupt or even destructive.
    </p>

      Once Flambeau entered her office on some typewriting business, and found
      she had just flung a pair of spectacles belonging to her sister into the
      middle of the floor and stamped on them. She was already in the rapids of
      an ethical tirade about the &ldquo;sickly medical notions&rdquo; and the morbid
      admission of weakness implied in such an apparatus. She dared her sister
      to bring such artificial, unhealthy rubbish into the place again. She
      asked if she was expected to wear wooden legs or false hair or glass eyes;
      and as she spoke her eyes sparkled like the terrible crystal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau, quite bewildered with this fanaticism, could not refrain from
      asking Miss Pauline (with direct French logic) why a pair of spectacles
      was a more morbid sign of weakness than a lift, and why, if science might
      help us in the one effort, it might not help us in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so different,&rdquo; said Pauline Stacey, loftily. &ldquo;Batteries and
      motors and all those things are marks of the force of man&mdash;yes, Mr.
      Flambeau, and the force of woman, too! We shall take our turn at these
      great engines that devour distance and defy time. That is high and
      splendid&mdash;that is really science. But these nasty props and plasters
      the doctors sell&mdash;why, they are just badges of poltroonery. Doctors
      stick on legs and arms as if we were born cripples and sick slaves. But I
      was free-born, Mr. Flambeau! People only think they need these things
      because they have been trained in fear instead of being trained in power
      and courage, just as the silly nurses tell children not to stare at the
      sun, and so they can&rsquo;t do it without blinking. But why among the stars
      should there be one star I may not see? The sun is not my master, and I
      will open my eyes and stare at him whenever I choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your eyes,&rdquo; said Flambeau, with a foreign bow, &ldquo;will dazzle the sun.&rdquo; He
      took pleasure in complimenting this strange stiff beauty, partly because
      it threw her a little off her balance. But as he went upstairs to his
      floor he drew a deep breath and whistled, saying to himself: &ldquo;So she has
      got into the hands of that conjurer upstairs with his golden eye.&rdquo; For,
      little as he knew or cared about the new religion of Kalon, he had heard
      of his special notion about sun-gazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon discovered that the spiritual bond between the floors above and
      below him was close and increasing. The man who called himself Kalon was a
      magnificent creature, worthy, in a physical sense, to be the pontiff of
      Apollo. He was nearly as tall even as Flambeau, and very much better
      looking, with a golden beard, strong blue eyes, and a mane flung back like
      a lion&rsquo;s. In structure he was the blonde beast of Nietzsche, but all this
      animal beauty was heightened, brightened and softened by genuine intellect
      and spirituality. If he looked like one of the great Saxon kings, he
      looked like one of the kings that were also saints. And this despite the
      cockney incongruity of his surroundings; the fact that he had an office
      half-way up a building in Victoria Street; that the clerk (a commonplace
      youth in cuffs and collars) sat in the outer room, between him and the
      corridor; that his name was on a brass plate, and the gilt emblem of his
      creed hung above his street, like the advertisement of an oculist. All
      this vulgarity could not take away from the man called Kalon the vivid
      oppression and inspiration that came from his soul and body. When all was
      said, a man in the presence of this quack did feel in the presence of a
      great man. Even in the loose jacket-suit of linen that he wore as a
      workshop dress in his office he was a fascinating and formidable figure;
      and when robed in the white vestments and crowned with the golden circlet,
      in which he daily saluted the sun, he really looked so splendid that the
      laughter of the street people sometimes died suddenly on their lips. For
      three times in the day the new sun-worshipper went out on his little
      balcony, in the face of all Westminster, to say some litany to his shining
      lord: once at daybreak, once at sunset, and once at the shock of noon. And
      it was while the shock of noon still shook faintly from the towers of
      Parliament and parish church that Father Brown, the friend of Flambeau,
      first looked up and saw the white priest of Apollo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau had seen quite enough of these daily salutations of Phoebus, and
      plunged into the porch of the tall building without even looking for his
      clerical friend to follow. But Father Brown, whether from a professional
      interest in ritual or a strong individual interest in tomfoolery, stopped
      and stared up at the balcony of the sun-worshipper, just as he might have
      stopped and stared up at a Punch and Judy. Kalon the Prophet was already
      erect, with argent garments and uplifted hands, and the sound of his
      strangely penetrating voice could be heard all the way down the busy
      street uttering his solar litany. He was already in the middle of it; his
      eyes were fixed upon the flaming disc. It is doubtful if he saw anything
      or anyone on this earth; it is substantially certain that he did not see a
      stunted, round-faced priest who, in the crowd below, looked up at him with
      blinking eyes. That was perhaps the most startling difference between even
      these two far divided men. Father Brown could not look at anything without
      blinking; but the priest of Apollo could look on the blaze at noon without
      a quiver of the eyelid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O sun,&rdquo; cried the prophet, &ldquo;O star that art too great to be allowed among
      the stars! O fountain that flowest quietly in that secret spot that is
      called space. White Father of all white unwearied things, white flames and
      white flowers and white peaks. Father, who art more innocent than all thy
      most innocent and quiet children; primal purity, into the peace of which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rush and crash like the reversed rush of a rocket was cloven with a
      strident and incessant yelling. Five people rushed into the gate of the
      mansions as three people rushed out, and for an instant they all deafened
      each other. The sense of some utterly abrupt horror seemed for a moment to
      fill half the street with bad news&mdash;bad news that was all the worse
      because no one knew what it was. Two figures remained still after the
      crash of commotion: the fair priest of Apollo on the balcony above, and
      the ugly priest of Christ below him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the tall figure and titanic energy of Flambeau appeared in the
      doorway of the mansions and dominated the little mob. Talking at the top
      of his voice like a fog-horn, he told somebody or anybody to go for a
      surgeon; and as he turned back into the dark and thronged entrance his
      friend Father Brown dipped in insignificantly after him. Even as he ducked
      and dived through the crowd he could still hear the magnificent melody and
      monotony of the solar priest still calling on the happy god who is the
      friend of fountains and flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown found Flambeau and some six other people standing round the
      enclosed space into which the lift commonly descended. But the lift had
      not descended. Something else had descended; something that ought to have
      come by a lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last four minutes Flambeau had looked down on it; had seen the
      brained and bleeding figure of that beautiful woman who denied the
      existence of tragedy. He had never had the slightest doubt that it was
      Pauline Stacey; and, though he had sent for a doctor, he had not the
      slightest doubt that she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not remember for certain whether he had liked her or disliked
      her; there was so much both to like and dislike. But she had been a person
      to him, and the unbearable pathos of details and habit stabbed him with
      all the small daggers of bereavement. He remembered her pretty face and
      priggish speeches with a sudden secret vividness which is all the
      bitterness of death. In an instant like a bolt from the blue, like a
      thunderbolt from nowhere, that beautiful and defiant body had been dashed
      down the open well of the lift to death at the bottom. Was it suicide?
      With so insolent an optimist it seemed impossible. Was it murder? But who
      was there in those hardly inhabited flats to murder anybody? In a rush of
      raucous words, which he meant to be strong and suddenly found weak, he
      asked where was that fellow Kalon. A voice, habitually heavy, quiet and
      full, assured him that Kalon for the last fifteen minutes had been away up
      on his balcony worshipping his god. When Flambeau heard the voice, and
      felt the hand of Father Brown, he turned his swarthy face and said
      abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if he has been up there all the time, who can have done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;we might go upstairs and find out. We have
      half an hour before the police will move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the body of the slain heiress in charge of the surgeons, Flambeau
      dashed up the stairs to the typewriting office, found it utterly empty,
      and then dashed up to his own. Having entered that, he abruptly returned
      with a new and white face to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sister,&rdquo; he said, with an unpleasant seriousness, &ldquo;her sister seems
      to have gone out for a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown nodded. &ldquo;Or, she may have gone up to the office of that sun
      man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I were you I should just verify that, and then let us
      all talk it over in your office. No,&rdquo; he added suddenly, as if remembering
      something, &ldquo;shall I ever get over that stupidity of mine? Of course, in
      their office downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau stared; but he followed the little father downstairs to the empty
      flat of the Staceys, where that impenetrable pastor took a large
      red-leather chair in the very entrance, from which he could see the stairs
      and landings, and waited. He did not wait very long. In about four minutes
      three figures descended the stairs, alike only in their solemnity. The
      first was Joan Stacey, the sister of the dead woman&mdash;evidently she
      had been upstairs in the temporary temple of Apollo; the second was the
      priest of Apollo himself, his litany finished, sweeping down the empty
      stairs in utter magnificence&mdash;something in his white robes, beard and
      parted hair had the look of Dore&rsquo;s Christ leaving the Pretorium; the third
      was Flambeau, black browed and somewhat bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Joan Stacey, dark, with a drawn face and hair prematurely touched
      with grey, walked straight to her own desk and set out her papers with a
      practical flap. The mere action rallied everyone else to sanity. If Miss
      Joan Stacey was a criminal, she was a cool one. Father Brown regarded her
      for some time with an odd little smile, and then, without taking his eyes
      off her, addressed himself to somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prophet,&rdquo; he said, presumably addressing Kalon, &ldquo;I wish you would tell me
      a lot about your religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be proud to do it,&rdquo; said Kalon, inclining his still crowned head,
      &ldquo;but I am not sure that I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said Father Brown, in his frankly doubtful way: &ldquo;We
      are taught that if a man has really bad first principles, that must be
      partly his fault. But, for all that, we can make some difference between a
      man who insults his quite clear conscience and a man with a conscience
      more or less clouded with sophistries. Now, do you really think that
      murder is wrong at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this an accusation?&rdquo; asked Kalon very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Brown, equally gently, &ldquo;it is the speech for the defence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the long and startled stillness of the room the prophet of Apollo
      slowly rose; and really it was like the rising of the sun. He filled that
      room with his light and life in such a manner that a man felt he could as
      easily have filled Salisbury Plain. His robed form seemed to hang the
      whole room with classic draperies; his epic gesture seemed to extend it
      into grander perspectives, till the little black figure of the modern
      cleric seemed to be a fault and an intrusion, a round, black blot upon
      some splendour of Hellas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We meet at last, Caiaphas,&rdquo; said the prophet. &ldquo;Your church and mine are
      the only realities on this earth. I adore the sun, and you the darkening
      of the sun; you are the priest of the dying and I of the living God. Your
      present work of suspicion and slander is worthy of your coat and creed.
      All your church is but a black police; you are only spies and detectives
      seeking to tear from men confessions of guilt, whether by treachery or
      torture. You would convict men of crime, I would convict them of
      innocence. You would convince them of sin, I would convince them of
      virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reader of the books of evil, one more word before I blow away your
      baseless nightmares for ever. Not even faintly could you understand how
      little I care whether you can convict me or no. The things you call
      disgrace and horrible hanging are to me no more than an ogre in a child&rsquo;s
      toy-book to a man once grown up. You said you were offering the speech for
      the defence. I care so little for the cloudland of this life that I will
      offer you the speech for the prosecution. There is but one thing that can
      be said against me in this matter, and I will say it myself. The woman
      that is dead was my love and my bride; not after such manner as your tin
      chapels call lawful, but by a law purer and sterner than you will ever
      understand. She and I walked another world from yours, and trod palaces of
      crystal while you were plodding through tunnels and corridors of brick.
      Well, I know that policemen, theological and otherwise, always fancy that
      where there has been love there must soon be hatred; so there you have the
      first point made for the prosecution. But the second point is stronger; I
      do not grudge it you. Not only is it true that Pauline loved me, but it is
      also true that this very morning, before she died, she wrote at that table
      a will leaving me and my new church half a million. Come, where are the
      handcuffs? Do you suppose I care what foolish things you do with me? Penal
      servitude will only be like waiting for her at a wayside station. The
      gallows will only be going to her in a headlong car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with the brain-shaking authority of an orator, and Flambeau and
      Joan Stacey stared at him in amazed admiration. Father Brown&rsquo;s face seemed
      to express nothing but extreme distress; he looked at the ground with one
      wrinkle of pain across his forehead. The prophet of the sun leaned easily
      against the mantelpiece and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few words I have put before you the whole case against me&mdash;the
      only possible case against me. In fewer words still I will blow it to
      pieces, so that not a trace of it remains. As to whether I have committed
      this crime, the truth is in one sentence: I could not have committed this
      crime. Pauline Stacey fell from this floor to the ground at five minutes
      past twelve. A hundred people will go into the witness-box and say that I
      was standing out upon the balcony of my own rooms above from just before
      the stroke of noon to a quarter-past&mdash;the usual period of my public
      prayers. My clerk (a respectable youth from Clapham, with no sort of
      connection with me) will swear that he sat in my outer office all the
      morning, and that no communication passed through. He will swear that I
      arrived a full ten minutes before the hour, fifteen minutes before any
      whisper of the accident, and that I did not leave the office or the
      balcony all that time. No one ever had so complete an alibi; I could
      subpoena half Westminster. I think you had better put the handcuffs away
      again. The case is at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But last of all, that no breath of this idiotic suspicion remain in the
      air, I will tell you all you want to know. I believe I do know how my
      unhappy friend came by her death. You can, if you choose, blame me for it,
      or my faith and philosophy at least; but you certainly cannot lock me up.
      It is well known to all students of the higher truths that certain adepts
      and illuminati have in history attained the power of levitation&mdash;that
      is, of being self-sustained upon the empty air. It is but a part of that
      general conquest of matter which is the main element in our occult wisdom.
      Poor Pauline was of an impulsive and ambitious temper. I think, to tell
      the truth, she thought herself somewhat deeper in the mysteries than she
      was; and she has often said to me, as we went down in the lift together,
      that if one&rsquo;s will were strong enough, one could float down as harmlessly
      as a feather. I solemnly believe that in some ecstasy of noble thoughts
      she attempted the miracle. Her will, or faith, must have failed her at the
      crucial instant, and the lower law of matter had its horrible revenge.
      There is the whole story, gentlemen, very sad and, as you think, very
      presumptuous and wicked, but certainly not criminal or in any way
      connected with me. In the short-hand of the police-courts, you had better
      call it suicide. I shall always call it heroic failure for the advance of
      science and the slow scaling of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time Flambeau had ever seen Father Brown vanquished. He
      still sat looking at the ground, with a painful and corrugated brow, as if
      in shame. It was impossible to avoid the feeling which the prophet&rsquo;s
      winged words had fanned, that here was a sullen, professional suspecter of
      men overwhelmed by a prouder and purer spirit of natural liberty and
      health. At last he said, blinking as if in bodily distress: &ldquo;Well, if that
      is so, sir, you need do no more than take the testamentary paper you spoke
      of and go. I wonder where the poor lady left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be over there on her desk by the door, I think,&rdquo; said Kalon, with
      that massive innocence of manner that seemed to acquit him wholly. &ldquo;She
      told me specially she would write it this morning, and I actually saw her
      writing as I went up in the lift to my own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was her door open then?&rdquo; asked the priest, with his eye on the corner of
      the matting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kalon calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it has been open ever since,&rdquo; said the other, and resumed his silent
      study of the mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a paper over here,&rdquo; said the grim Miss Joan, in a somewhat
      singular voice. She had passed over to her sister&rsquo;s desk by the doorway,
      and was holding a sheet of blue foolscap in her hand. There was a sour
      smile on her face that seemed unfit for such a scene or occasion, and
      Flambeau looked at her with a darkening brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kalon the prophet stood away from the paper with that loyal
      unconsciousness that had carried him through. But Flambeau took it out of
      the lady&rsquo;s hand, and read it with the utmost amazement. It did, indeed,
      begin in the formal manner of a will, but after the words &ldquo;I give and
      bequeath all of which I die possessed&rdquo; the writing abruptly stopped with a
      set of scratches, and there was no trace of the name of any legatee.
      Flambeau, in wonder, handed this truncated testament to his clerical
      friend, who glanced at it and silently gave it to the priest of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant afterwards that pontiff, in his splendid sweeping draperies,
      had crossed the room in two great strides, and was towering over Joan
      Stacey, his blue eyes standing from his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What monkey tricks have you been playing here?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all
      Pauline wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were startled to hear him speak in quite a new voice, with a Yankee
      shrillness in it; all his grandeur and good English had fallen from him
      like a cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the only thing on her desk,&rdquo; said Joan, and confronted him
      steadily with the same smile of evil favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden the man broke out into blasphemies and cataracts of
      incredulous words. There was something shocking about the dropping of his
      mask; it was like a man&rsquo;s real face falling off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; he cried in broad American, when he was breathless with
      cursing, &ldquo;I may be an adventurer, but I guess you&rsquo;re a murderess. Yes,
      gentlemen, here&rsquo;s your death explained, and without any levitation. The
      poor girl is writing a will in my favour; her cursed sister comes in,
      struggles for the pen, drags her to the well, and throws her down before
      she can finish it. Sakes! I reckon we want the handcuffs after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you have truly remarked,&rdquo; replied Joan, with ugly calm, &ldquo;your clerk is
      a very respectable young man, who knows the nature of an oath; and he will
      swear in any court that I was up in your office arranging some typewriting
      work for five minutes before and five minutes after my sister fell. Mr.
      Flambeau will tell you that he found me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; cried Flambeau, &ldquo;Pauline was alone when she fell, and it was
      suicide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was alone when she fell,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;but it was not
      suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did she die?&rdquo; asked Flambeau impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was murdered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she was alone,&rdquo; objected the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was murdered when she was all alone,&rdquo; answered the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest stared at him, but he remained sitting in the same old
      dejected attitude, with a wrinkle in his round forehead and an appearance
      of impersonal shame and sorrow; his voice was colourless and sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to know,&rdquo; cried Kalon, with an oath, &ldquo;is when the police are
      coming for this bloody and wicked sister. She&rsquo;s killed her flesh and
      blood; she&rsquo;s robbed me of half a million that was just as sacredly mine as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, prophet,&rdquo; interrupted Flambeau, with a kind of sneer;
      &ldquo;remember that all this world is a cloudland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hierophant of the sun-god made an effort to climb back on his
      pedestal. &ldquo;It is not the mere money,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;though that would equip
      the cause throughout the world. It is also my beloved one&rsquo;s wishes. To
      Pauline all this was holy. In Pauline&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown suddenly sprang erect, so that his chair fell over flat
      behind him. He was deathly pale, yet he seemed fired with a hope; his eyes
      shone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he cried in a clear voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to begin. In
      Pauline&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall prophet retreated before the tiny priest in an almost mad
      disorder. &ldquo;What do you mean? How dare you?&rdquo; he cried repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Pauline&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; repeated the priest, his own shining more and more.
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;in God&rsquo;s name, go on. The foulest crime the fiends ever
      prompted feels lighter after confession; and I implore you to confess. Go
      on, go on&mdash;in Pauline&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, you devil!&rdquo; thundered Kalon, struggling like a giant in bonds.
      &ldquo;Who are you, you cursed spy, to weave your spiders&rsquo; webs round me, and
      peep and peer? Let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I stop him?&rdquo; asked Flambeau, bounding towards the exit, for Kalon
      had already thrown the door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; let him pass,&rdquo; said Father Brown, with a strange deep sigh that
      seemed to come from the depths of the universe. &ldquo;Let Cain pass by, for he
      belongs to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long-drawn silence in the room when he had left it, which was
      to Flambeau&rsquo;s fierce wits one long agony of interrogation. Miss Joan
      Stacey very coolly tidied up the papers on her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Flambeau at last, &ldquo;it is my duty, not my curiosity only&mdash;it
      is my duty to find out, if I can, who committed the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which crime?&rdquo; asked Father Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one we are dealing with, of course,&rdquo; replied his impatient friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are dealing with two crimes,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;crimes of very different
      weight&mdash;and by very different criminals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Joan Stacey, having collected and put away her papers, proceeded to
      lock up her drawer. Father Brown went on, noticing her as little as she
      noticed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two crimes,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;were committed against the same weakness
      of the same person, in a struggle for her money. The author of the larger
      crime found himself thwarted by the smaller crime; the author of the
      smaller crime got the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go on like a lecturer,&rdquo; groaned Flambeau; &ldquo;put it in a few
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can put it in one word,&rdquo; answered his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Joan Stacey skewered her business-like black hat on to her head with
      a business-like black frown before a little mirror, and, as the
      conversation proceeded, took her handbag and umbrella in an unhurried
      style, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is one word, and a short one,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;Pauline
      Stacey was blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind!&rdquo; repeated Flambeau, and rose slowly to his whole huge stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was subject to it by blood,&rdquo; Brown proceeded. &ldquo;Her sister would have
      started eyeglasses if Pauline would have let her; but it was her special
      philosophy or fad that one must not encourage such diseases by yielding to
      them. She would not admit the cloud; or she tried to dispel it by will. So
      her eyes got worse and worse with straining; but the worst strain was to
      come. It came with this precious prophet, or whatever he calls himself,
      who taught her to stare at the hot sun with the naked eye. It was called
      accepting Apollo. Oh, if these new pagans would only be old pagans, they
      would be a little wiser! The old pagans knew that mere naked
      Nature-worship must have a cruel side. They knew that the eye of Apollo
      can blast and blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and the priest went on in a gentle and even broken
      voice. &ldquo;Whether or no that devil deliberately made her blind, there is no
      doubt that he deliberately killed her through her blindness. The very
      simplicity of the crime is sickening. You know he and she went up and down
      in those lifts without official help; you know also how smoothly and
      silently the lifts slide. Kalon brought the lift to the girl&rsquo;s landing,
      and saw her, through the open door, writing in her slow, sightless way the
      will she had promised him. He called out to her cheerily that he had the
      lift ready for her, and she was to come out when she was ready. Then he
      pressed a button and shot soundlessly up to his own floor, walked through
      his own office, out on to his own balcony, and was safely praying before
      the crowded street when the poor girl, having finished her work, ran gaily
      out to where lover and lift were to receive her, and stepped&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to have got half a million by pressing that button,&rdquo; continued
      the little father, in the colourless voice in which he talked of such
      horrors. &ldquo;But that went smash. It went smash because there happened to be
      another person who also wanted the money, and who also knew the secret
      about poor Pauline&rsquo;s sight. There was one thing about that will that I
      think nobody noticed: although it was unfinished and without signature,
      the other Miss Stacey and some servant of hers had already signed it as
      witnesses. Joan had signed first, saying Pauline could finish it later,
      with a typical feminine contempt for legal forms. Therefore, Joan wanted
      her sister to sign the will without real witnesses. Why? I thought of the
      blindness, and felt sure she had wanted Pauline to sign in solitude
      because she had wanted her not to sign at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People like the Staceys always use fountain pens; but this was specially
      natural to Pauline. By habit and her strong will and memory she could
      still write almost as well as if she saw; but she could not tell when her
      pen needed dipping. Therefore, her fountain pens were carefully filled by
      her sister&mdash;all except this fountain pen. This was carefully not
      filled by her sister; the remains of the ink held out for a few lines and
      then failed altogether. And the prophet lost five hundred thousand pounds
      and committed one of the most brutal and brilliant murders in human
      history for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau went to the open door and heard the official police ascending the
      stairs. He turned and said: &ldquo;You must have followed everything devilish
      close to have traced the crime to Kalon in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown gave a sort of start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! to him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No; I had to follow rather close to find out about
      Miss Joan and the fountain pen. But I knew Kalon was the criminal before I
      came into the front door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be joking!&rdquo; cried Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite serious,&rdquo; answered the priest. &ldquo;I tell you I knew he had done
      it, even before I knew what he had done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These pagan stoics,&rdquo; said Brown reflectively, &ldquo;always fail by their
      strength. There came a crash and a scream down the street, and the priest
      of Apollo did not start or look round. I did not know what it was. But I
      knew that he was expecting it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      The Sign of the Broken Sword
    </h2>
    <p>
      The thousand arms of the forest were grey, and its million fingers silver.
      In a sky of dark green-blue-like slate the stars were bleak and brilliant
      like splintered ice. All that thickly wooded and sparsely tenanted
      countryside was stiff with a bitter and brittle frost. The black hollows
      between the trunks of the trees looked like bottomless, black caverns of
      that Scandinavian hell, a hell of incalculable cold. Even the square stone
      tower of the church looked northern to the point of heathenry, as if it
      were some barbaric tower among the sea rocks of Iceland. It was a queer
      night for anyone to explore a churchyard. But, on the other hand, perhaps
      it was worth exploring.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rose abruptly out of the ashen wastes of forest in a sort of hump or
      shoulder of green turf that looked grey in the starlight. Most of the
      graves were on a slant, and the path leading up to the church was as steep
      as a staircase. On the top of the hill, in the one flat and prominent
      place, was the monument for which the place was famous. It contrasted
      strangely with the featureless graves all round, for it was the work of
      one of the greatest sculptors of modern Europe; and yet his fame was at
      once forgotten in the fame of the man whose image he had made. It showed,
      by touches of the small silver pencil of starlight, the massive metal
      figure of a soldier recumbent, the strong hands sealed in an everlasting
      worship, the great head pillowed upon a gun. The venerable face was
      bearded, or rather whiskered, in the old, heavy Colonel Newcome fashion.
      The uniform, though suggested with the few strokes of simplicity, was that
      of modern war. By his right side lay a sword, of which the tip was broken
      off; on the left side lay a Bible. On glowing summer afternoons wagonettes
      came full of Americans and cultured suburbans to see the sepulchre; but
      even then they felt the vast forest land with its one dumpy dome of
      churchyard and church as a place oddly dumb and neglected. In this
      freezing darkness of mid-winter one would think he might be left alone
      with the stars. Nevertheless, in the stillness of those stiff woods a
      wooden gate creaked, and two dim figures dressed in black climbed up the
      little path to the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      So faint was that frigid starlight that nothing could have been traced
      about them except that while they both wore black, one man was enormously
      big, and the other (perhaps by contrast) almost startlingly small. They
      went up to the great graven tomb of the historic warrior, and stood for a
      few minutes staring at it. There was no human, perhaps no living, thing
      for a wide circle; and a morbid fancy might well have wondered if they
      were human themselves. In any case, the beginning of their conversation
      might have seemed strange. After the first silence the small man said to
      the other:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does a wise man hide a pebble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the tall man answered in a low voice: &ldquo;On the beach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small man nodded, and after a short silence said: &ldquo;Where does a wise
      man hide a leaf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the other answered: &ldquo;In the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another stillness, and then the tall man resumed: &ldquo;Do you mean
      that when a wise man has to hide a real diamond he has been known to hide
      it among sham ones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the little man with a laugh, &ldquo;we will let bygones be
      bygones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stamped his cold feet for a second or two, and then said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      thinking of that at all, but of something else; something rather peculiar.
      Just strike a match, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big man fumbled in his pocket, and soon a scratch and a flare painted
      gold the whole flat side of the monument. On it was cut in black letters
      the well-known words which so many Americans had reverently read: &ldquo;Sacred
      to the Memory of General Sir Arthur St. Clare, Hero and Martyr, who Always
      Vanquished his Enemies and Always Spared Them, and Was Treacherously Slain
      by Them At Last. May God in Whom he Trusted both Reward and Revenge him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The match burnt the big man&rsquo;s fingers, blackened, and dropped. He was
      about to strike another, but his small companion stopped him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all
      right, Flambeau, old man; I saw what I wanted. Or, rather, I didn&rsquo;t see
      what I didn&rsquo;t want. And now we must walk a mile and a half along the road
      to the next inn, and I will try to tell you all about it. For Heaven knows
      a man should have a fire and ale when he dares tell such a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended the precipitous path, they relatched the rusty gate, and
      set off at a stamping, ringing walk down the frozen forest road. They had
      gone a full quarter of a mile before the smaller man spoke again. He said:
      &ldquo;Yes; the wise man hides a pebble on the beach. But what does he do if
      there is no beach? Do you know anything of that great St. Clare trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about English generals, Father Brown,&rdquo; answered the large
      man, laughing, &ldquo;though a little about English policemen. I only know that
      you have dragged me a precious long dance to all the shrines of this
      fellow, whoever he is. One would think he got buried in six different
      places. I&rsquo;ve seen a memorial to General St. Clare in Westminster Abbey.
      I&rsquo;ve seen a ramping equestrian statue of General St. Clare on the
      Embankment. I&rsquo;ve seen a medallion of St. Clare in the street he was born
      in, and another in the street he lived in; and now you drag me after dark
      to his coffin in the village churchyard. I am beginning to be a bit tired
      of his magnificent personality, especially as I don&rsquo;t in the least know
      who he was. What are you hunting for in all these crypts and effigies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only looking for one word,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;A word that isn&rsquo;t
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Flambeau; &ldquo;are you going to tell me anything about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must divide it into two parts,&rdquo; remarked the priest. &ldquo;First there is
      what everybody knows; and then there is what I know. Now, what everybody
      knows is short and plain enough. It is also entirely wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said the big man called Flambeau cheerfully. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin
      at the wrong end. Let&rsquo;s begin with what everybody knows, which isn&rsquo;t
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not wholly untrue, it is at least very inadequate,&rdquo; continued Brown;
      &ldquo;for in point of fact, all that the public knows amounts precisely to
      this: The public knows that Arthur St. Clare was a great and successful
      English general. It knows that after splendid yet careful campaigns both
      in India and Africa he was in command against Brazil when the great
      Brazilian patriot Olivier issued his ultimatum. It knows that on that
      occasion St. Clare with a very small force attacked Olivier with a very
      large one, and was captured after heroic resistance. And it knows that
      after his capture, and to the abhorrence of the civilised world, St. Clare
      was hanged on the nearest tree. He was found swinging there after the
      Brazilians had retired, with his broken sword hung round his neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that popular story is untrue?&rdquo; suggested Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his friend quietly, &ldquo;that story is quite true, so far as it
      goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it goes far enough!&rdquo; said Flambeau; &ldquo;but if the popular
      story is true, what is the mystery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had passed many hundreds of grey and ghostly trees before the little
      priest answered. Then he bit his finger reflectively and said: &ldquo;Why, the
      mystery is a mystery of psychology. Or, rather, it is a mystery of two
      psychologies. In that Brazilian business two of the most famous men of
      modern history acted flat against their characters. Mind you, Olivier and
      St. Clare were both heroes&mdash;the old thing, and no mistake; it was
      like the fight between Hector and Achilles. Now, what would you say to an
      affair in which Achilles was timid and Hector was treacherous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the large man impatiently as the other bit his finger again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Arthur St. Clare was a soldier of the old religious type&mdash;the
      type that saved us during the Mutiny,&rdquo; continued Brown. &ldquo;He was always
      more for duty than for dash; and with all his personal courage was
      decidedly a prudent commander, particularly indignant at any needless
      waste of soldiers. Yet in this last battle he attempted something that a
      baby could see was absurd. One need not be a strategist to see it was as
      wild as wind; just as one need not be a strategist to keep out of the way
      of a motor-bus. Well, that is the first mystery; what had become of the
      English general&rsquo;s head? The second riddle is, what had become of the
      Brazilian general&rsquo;s heart? President Olivier might be called a visionary
      or a nuisance; but even his enemies admitted that he was magnanimous to
      the point of knight errantry. Almost every other prisoner he had ever
      captured had been set free or even loaded with benefits. Men who had
      really wronged him came away touched by his simplicity and sweetness. Why
      the deuce should he diabolically revenge himself only once in his life;
      and that for the one particular blow that could not have hurt him? Well,
      there you have it. One of the wisest men in the world acted like an idiot
      for no reason. One of the best men in the world acted like a fiend for no
      reason. That&rsquo;s the long and the short of it; and I leave it to you, my
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other with a snort. &ldquo;I leave it to you; and you
      jolly well tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Father Brown, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fair to say that the public
      impression is just what I&rsquo;ve said, without adding that two things have
      happened since. I can&rsquo;t say they threw a new light; for nobody can make
      sense of them. But they threw a new kind of darkness; they threw the
      darkness in new directions. The first was this. The family physician of
      the St. Clares quarrelled with that family, and began publishing a violent
      series of articles, in which he said that the late general was a religious
      maniac; but as far as the tale went, this seemed to mean little more than
      a religious man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, the story fizzled out. Everyone knew, of course, that St. Clare
      had some of the eccentricities of puritan piety. The second incident was
      much more arresting. In the luckless and unsupported regiment which made
      that rash attempt at the Black River there was a certain Captain Keith,
      who was at that time engaged to St. Clare&rsquo;s daughter, and who afterwards
      married her. He was one of those who were captured by Olivier, and, like
      all the rest except the general, appears to have been bounteously treated
      and promptly set free. Some twenty years afterwards this man, then
      Lieutenant-Colonel Keith, published a sort of autobiography called &lsquo;A
      British Officer in Burmah and Brazil.&rsquo; In the place where the reader looks
      eagerly for some account of the mystery of St. Clare&rsquo;s disaster may be
      found the following words: &lsquo;Everywhere else in this book I have narrated
      things exactly as they occurred, holding as I do the old-fashioned opinion
      that the glory of England is old enough to take care of itself. The
      exception I shall make is in this matter of the defeat by the Black River;
      and my reasons, though private, are honourable and compelling. I will,
      however, add this in justice to the memories of two distinguished men.
      General St. Clare has been accused of incapacity on this occasion; I can
      at least testify that this action, properly understood, was one of the
      most brilliant and sagacious of his life. President Olivier by similar
      report is charged with savage injustice. I think it due to the honour of
      an enemy to say that he acted on this occasion with even more than his
      characteristic good feeling. To put the matter popularly, I can assure my
      countrymen that St. Clare was by no means such a fool nor Olivier such a
      brute as he looked. This is all I have to say; nor shall any earthly
      consideration induce me to add a word to it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A large frozen moon like a lustrous snowball began to show through the
      tangle of twigs in front of them, and by its light the narrator had been
      able to refresh his memory of Captain Keith&rsquo;s text from a scrap of printed
      paper. As he folded it up and put it back in his pocket Flambeau threw up
      his hand with a French gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit, wait a bit,&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;I believe I can guess it at
      the first go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode on, breathing hard, his black head and bull neck forward, like a
      man winning a walking race. The little priest, amused and interested, had
      some trouble in trotting beside him. Just before them the trees fell back
      a little to left and right, and the road swept downwards across a clear,
      moonlit valley, till it dived again like a rabbit into the wall of another
      wood. The entrance to the farther forest looked small and round, like the
      black hole of a remote railway tunnel. But it was within some hundred
      yards, and gaped like a cavern before Flambeau spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he cried at last, slapping his thigh with his great hand.
      &ldquo;Four minutes&rsquo; thinking, and I can tell your whole story myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented his friend. &ldquo;You tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau lifted his head, but lowered his voice. &ldquo;General Sir Arthur St.
      Clare,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;came of a family in which madness was hereditary; and
      his whole aim was to keep this from his daughter, and even, if possible,
      from his future son-in-law. Rightly or wrongly, he thought the final
      collapse was close, and resolved on suicide. Yet ordinary suicide would
      blazon the very idea he dreaded. As the campaign approached the clouds
      came thicker on his brain; and at last in a mad moment he sacrificed his
      public duty to his private. He rushed rashly into battle, hoping to fall
      by the first shot. When he found that he had only attained capture and
      discredit, the sealed bomb in his brain burst, and he broke his own sword
      and hanged himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared firmly at the grey facade of forest in front of him, with the
      one black gap in it, like the mouth of the grave, into which their path
      plunged. Perhaps something menacing in the road thus suddenly swallowed
      reinforced his vivid vision of the tragedy, for he shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horrid story,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horrid story,&rdquo; repeated the priest with bent head. &ldquo;But not the real
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he threw back his head with a sort of despair and cried: &ldquo;Oh, I wish
      it had been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall Flambeau faced round and stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours is a clean story,&rdquo; cried Father Brown, deeply moved. &ldquo;A sweet,
      pure, honest story, as open and white as that moon. Madness and despair
      are innocent enough. There are worse things, Flambeau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau looked up wildly at the moon thus invoked; and from where he
      stood one black tree-bough curved across it exactly like a devil&rsquo;s horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father&mdash;father,&rdquo; cried Flambeau with the French gesture and stepping
      yet more rapidly forward, &ldquo;do you mean it was worse than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; said Paul like a grave echo. And they plunged into the
      black cloister of the woodland, which ran by them in a dim tapestry of
      trunks, like one of the dark corridors in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soon in the most secret entrails of the wood, and felt close
      about them foliage that they could not see, when the priest said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest. But what does he do if
      there is no forest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; cried Flambeau irritably, &ldquo;what does he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He grows a forest to hide it in,&rdquo; said the priest in an obscure voice. &ldquo;A
      fearful sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; cried his friend impatiently, for the dark wood and the dark
      saying got a little on his nerves; &ldquo;will you tell me this story or not?
      What other evidence is there to go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three more bits of evidence,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;that I have dug
      up in holes and corners; and I will give them in logical rather than
      chronological order. First of all, of course, our authority for the issue
      and event of the battle is in Olivier&rsquo;s own dispatches, which are lucid
      enough. He was entrenched with two or three regiments on the heights that
      swept down to the Black River, on the other side of which was lower and
      more marshy ground. Beyond this again was gently rising country, on which
      was the first English outpost, supported by others which lay, however,
      considerably in its rear. The British forces as a whole were greatly
      superior in numbers; but this particular regiment was just far enough from
      its base to make Olivier consider the project of crossing the river to cut
      it off. By sunset, however, he had decided to retain his own position,
      which was a specially strong one. At daybreak next morning he was
      thunderstruck to see that this stray handful of English, entirely
      unsupported from their rear, had flung themselves across the river, half
      by a bridge to the right, and the other half by a ford higher up, and were
      massed upon the marshy bank below him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they should attempt an attack with such numbers against such a
      position was incredible enough; but Olivier noticed something yet more
      extraordinary. For instead of attempting to seize more solid ground, this
      mad regiment, having put the river in its rear by one wild charge, did
      nothing more, but stuck there in the mire like flies in treacle. Needless
      to say, the Brazilians blew great gaps in them with artillery, which they
      could only return with spirited but lessening rifle fire. Yet they never
      broke; and Olivier&rsquo;s curt account ends with a strong tribute of admiration
      for the mystic valour of these imbeciles. &lsquo;Our line then advanced
      finally,&rsquo; writes Olivier, &lsquo;and drove them into the river; we captured
      General St. Clare himself and several other officers. The colonel and the
      major had both fallen in the battle. I cannot resist saying that few finer
      sights can have been seen in history than the last stand of this
      extraordinary regiment; wounded officers picking up the rifles of dead
      soldiers, and the general himself facing us on horseback bareheaded and
      with a broken sword.&rsquo; On what happened to the general afterwards Olivier
      is as silent as Captain Keith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; grunted Flambeau, &ldquo;get on to the next bit of evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next evidence,&rdquo; said Father Brown, &ldquo;took some time to find, but it
      will not take long to tell. I found at last in an almshouse down in the
      Lincolnshire Fens an old soldier who not only was wounded at the Black
      River, but had actually knelt beside the colonel of the regiment when he
      died. This latter was a certain Colonel Clancy, a big bull of an Irishman;
      and it would seem that he died almost as much of rage as of bullets. He,
      at any rate, was not responsible for that ridiculous raid; it must have
      been imposed on him by the general. His last edifying words, according to
      my informant, were these: &lsquo;And there goes the damned old donkey with the
      end of his sword knocked off. I wish it was his head.&rsquo; You will remark
      that everyone seems to have noticed this detail about the broken sword
      blade, though most people regard it somewhat more reverently than did the
      late Colonel Clancy. And now for the third fragment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their path through the woodland began to go upward, and the speaker paused
      a little for breath before he went on. Then he continued in the same
      business-like tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a month or two ago a certain Brazilian official died in England,
      having quarrelled with Olivier and left his country. He was a well-known
      figure both here and on the Continent, a Spaniard named Espado; I knew him
      myself, a yellow-faced old dandy, with a hooked nose. For various private
      reasons I had permission to see the documents he had left; he was a
      Catholic, of course, and I had been with him towards the end. There was
      nothing of his that lit up any corner of the black St. Clare business,
      except five or six common exercise books filled with the diary of some
      English soldier. I can only suppose that it was found by the Brazilians on
      one of those that fell. Anyhow, it stopped abruptly the night before the
      battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the account of that last day in the poor fellow&rsquo;s life was certainly
      worth reading. I have it on me; but it&rsquo;s too dark to read it here, and I
      will give you a resume. The first part of that entry is full of jokes,
      evidently flung about among the men, about somebody called the Vulture. It
      does not seem as if this person, whoever he was, was one of themselves,
      nor even an Englishman; neither is he exactly spoken of as one of the
      enemy. It sounds rather as if he were some local go-between and
      non-combatant; perhaps a guide or a journalist. He has been closeted with
      old Colonel Clancy; but is more often seen talking to the major. Indeed,
      the major is somewhat prominent in this soldier&rsquo;s narrative; a lean,
      dark-haired man, apparently, of the name of Murray&mdash;a north of
      Ireland man and a Puritan. There are continual jests about the contrast
      between this Ulsterman&rsquo;s austerity and the conviviality of Colonel Clancy.
      There is also some joke about the Vulture wearing bright-coloured clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all these levities are scattered by what may well be called the note
      of a bugle. Behind the English camp and almost parallel to the river ran
      one of the few great roads of that district. Westward the road curved
      round towards the river, which it crossed by the bridge before mentioned.
      To the east the road swept backwards into the wilds, and some two miles
      along it was the next English outpost. From this direction there came
      along the road that evening a glitter and clatter of light cavalry, in
      which even the simple diarist could recognise with astonishment the
      general with his staff. He rode the great white horse which you have seen
      so often in illustrated papers and Academy pictures; and you may be sure
      that the salute they gave him was not merely ceremonial. He, at least,
      wasted no time on ceremony, but, springing from the saddle immediately,
      mixed with the group of officers, and fell into emphatic though
      confidential speech. What struck our friend the diarist most was his
      special disposition to discuss matters with Major Murray; but, indeed,
      such a selection, so long as it was not marked, was in no way unnatural.
      The two men were made for sympathy; they were men who &lsquo;read their Bibles&rsquo;;
      they were both the old Evangelical type of officer. However this may be,
      it is certain that when the general mounted again he was still talking
      earnestly to Murray; and that as he walked his horse slowly down the road
      towards the river, the tall Ulsterman still walked by his bridle rein in
      earnest debate. The soldiers watched the two until they vanished behind a
      clump of trees where the road turned towards the river. The colonel had
      gone back to his tent, and the men to their pickets; the man with the
      diary lingered for another four minutes, and saw a marvellous sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great white horse which had marched slowly down the road, as it had
      marched in so many processions, flew back, galloping up the road towards
      them as if it were mad to win a race. At first they thought it had run
      away with the man on its back; but they soon saw that the general, a fine
      rider, was himself urging it to full speed. Horse and man swept up to them
      like a whirlwind; and then, reining up the reeling charger, the general
      turned on them a face like flame, and called for the colonel like the
      trumpet that wakes the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conceive that all the earthquake events of that catastrophe tumbled on
      top of each other rather like lumber in the minds of men such as our
      friend with the diary. With the dazed excitement of a dream, they found
      themselves falling&mdash;literally falling&mdash;into their ranks, and
      learned that an attack was to be led at once across the river. The general
      and the major, it was said, had found out something at the bridge, and
      there was only just time to strike for life. The major had gone back at
      once to call up the reserve along the road behind; it was doubtful if even
      with that prompt appeal help could reach them in time. But they must pass
      the stream that night, and seize the heights by morning. It is with the
      very stir and throb of that romantic nocturnal march that the diary
      suddenly ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown had mounted ahead; for the woodland path grew smaller,
      steeper, and more twisted, till they felt as if they were ascending a
      winding staircase. The priest&rsquo;s voice came from above out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one other little and enormous thing. When the general urged
      them to their chivalric charge he half drew his sword from the scabbard;
      and then, as if ashamed of such melodrama, thrust it back again. The sword
      again, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half-light broke through the network of boughs above them, flinging the
      ghost of a net about their feet; for they were mounting again to the faint
      luminosity of the naked night. Flambeau felt truth all round him as an
      atmosphere, but not as an idea. He answered with bewildered brain: &ldquo;Well,
      what&rsquo;s the matter with the sword? Officers generally have swords, don&rsquo;t
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not often mentioned in modern war,&rdquo; said the other
      dispassionately; &ldquo;but in this affair one falls over the blessed sword
      everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is there in that?&rdquo; growled Flambeau; &ldquo;it was a twopence
      coloured sort of incident; the old man&rsquo;s blade breaking in his last
      battle. Anyone might bet the papers would get hold of it, as they have. On
      all these tombs and things it&rsquo;s shown broken at the point. I hope you
      haven&rsquo;t dragged me through this Polar expedition merely because two men
      with an eye for a picture saw St. Clare&rsquo;s broken sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Father Brown, with a sharp voice like a pistol shot; &ldquo;but who
      saw his unbroken sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried the other, and stood still under the stars. They
      had come abruptly out of the grey gates of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, who saw his unbroken sword?&rdquo; repeated Father Brown obstinately.
      &ldquo;Not the writer of the diary, anyhow; the general sheathed it in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau looked about him in the moonlight, as a man struck blind might
      look in the sun; and his friend went on, for the first time with
      eagerness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flambeau,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I cannot prove it, even after hunting through the
      tombs. But I am sure of it. Let me add just one more tiny fact that tips
      the whole thing over. The colonel, by a strange chance, was one of the
      first struck by a bullet. He was struck long before the troops came to
      close quarters. But he saw St. Clare&rsquo;s sword broken. Why was it broken?
      How was it broken? My friend, it was broken before the battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said his friend, with a sort of forlorn jocularity; &ldquo;and pray where
      is the other piece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you,&rdquo; said the priest promptly. &ldquo;In the northeast corner of
      the cemetery of the Protestant Cathedral at Belfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; inquired the other. &ldquo;Have you looked for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Brown, with frank regret. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great marble
      monument on top of it; a monument to the heroic Major Murray, who fell
      fighting gloriously at the famous Battle of the Black River.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau seemed suddenly galvanised into existence. &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he cried
      hoarsely, &ldquo;that General St. Clare hated Murray, and murdered him on the
      field of battle because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still full of good and pure thoughts,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It was
      worse than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the large man, &ldquo;my stock of evil imagination is used up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest seemed really doubtful where to begin, and at last he said
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where would a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were no forest, he would make a forest. And if he wished to hide
      a dead leaf, he would make a dead forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was still no reply, and the priest added still more mildly and
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if a man had to hide a dead body, he would make a field of dead
      bodies to hide it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau began to stamp forward with an intolerance of delay in time or
      space; but Father Brown went on as if he were continuing the last
      sentence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Arthur St. Clare, as I have already said, was a man who read his
      Bible. That was what was the matter with him. When will people understand
      that it is useless for a man to read his Bible unless he also reads
      everybody else&rsquo;s Bible? A printer reads a Bible for misprints. A Mormon
      reads his Bible, and finds polygamy; a Christian Scientist reads his, and
      finds we have no arms and legs. St. Clare was an old Anglo-Indian
      Protestant soldier. Now, just think what that might mean; and, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t cant about it. It might mean a man physically
      formidable living under a tropic sun in an Oriental society, and soaking
      himself without sense or guidance in an Oriental Book. Of course, he read
      the Old Testament rather than the New. Of course, he found in the Old
      Testament anything that he wanted&mdash;lust, tyranny, treason. Oh, I dare
      say he was honest, as you call it. But what is the good of a man being
      honest in his worship of dishonesty?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In each of the hot and secret countries to which the man went he kept a
      harem, he tortured witnesses, he amassed shameful gold; but certainly he
      would have said with steady eyes that he did it to the glory of the Lord.
      My own theology is sufficiently expressed by asking which Lord? Anyhow,
      there is this about such evil, that it opens door after door in hell, and
      always into smaller and smaller chambers. This is the real case against
      crime, that a man does not become wilder and wilder, but only meaner and
      meaner. St. Clare was soon suffocated by difficulties of bribery and
      blackmail; and needed more and more cash. And by the time of the Battle of
      the Black River he had fallen from world to world to that place which
      Dante makes the lowest floor of the universe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked his friend again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that,&rdquo; retorted the cleric, and suddenly pointed at a puddle
      sealed with ice that shone in the moon. &ldquo;Do you remember whom Dante put in
      the last circle of ice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The traitors,&rdquo; said Flambeau, and shuddered. As he looked around at the
      inhuman landscape of trees, with taunting and almost obscene outlines, he
      could almost fancy he was Dante, and the priest with the rivulet of a
      voice was, indeed, a Virgil leading him through a land of eternal sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice went on: &ldquo;Olivier, as you know, was quixotic, and would not
      permit a secret service and spies. The thing, however, was done, like many
      other things, behind his back. It was managed by my old friend Espado; he
      was the bright-clad fop, whose hook nose got him called the Vulture.
      Posing as a sort of philanthropist at the front, he felt his way through
      the English Army, and at last got his fingers on its one corrupt man&mdash;please
      God!&mdash;and that man at the top. St. Clare was in foul need of money,
      and mountains of it. The discredited family doctor was threatening those
      extraordinary exposures that afterwards began and were broken off; tales
      of monstrous and prehistoric things in Park Lane; things done by an
      English Evangelist that smelt like human sacrifice and hordes of slaves.
      Money was wanted, too, for his daughter&rsquo;s dowry; for to him the fame of
      wealth was as sweet as wealth itself. He snapped the last thread,
      whispered the word to Brazil, and wealth poured in from the enemies of
      England. But another man had talked to Espado the Vulture as well as he.
      Somehow the dark, grim young major from Ulster had guessed the hideous
      truth; and when they walked slowly together down that road towards the
      bridge Murray was telling the general that he must resign instantly, or be
      court-martialled and shot. The general temporised with him till they came
      to the fringe of tropic trees by the bridge; and there by the singing
      river and the sunlit palms (for I can see the picture) the general drew
      his sabre and plunged it through the body of the major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wintry road curved over a ridge in cutting frost, with cruel black
      shapes of bush and thicket; but Flambeau fancied that he saw beyond it
      faintly the edge of an aureole that was not starlight and moonlight, but
      some fire such as is made by men. He watched it as the tale drew to its
      close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Clare was a hell-hound, but he was a hound of breed. Never, I&rsquo;ll
      swear, was he so lucid and so strong as when poor Murray lay a cold lump
      at his feet. Never in all his triumphs, as Captain Keith said truly, was
      the great man so great as he was in this last world-despised defeat. He
      looked coolly at his weapon to wipe off the blood; he saw the point he had
      planted between his victim&rsquo;s shoulders had broken off in the body. He saw
      quite calmly, as through a club windowpane, all that must follow. He saw
      that men must find the unaccountable corpse; must extract the
      unaccountable sword-point; must notice the unaccountable broken sword&mdash;or
      absence of sword. He had killed, but not silenced. But his imperious
      intellect rose against the facer; there was one way yet. He could make the
      corpse less unaccountable. He could create a hill of corpses to cover this
      one. In twenty minutes eight hundred English soldiers were marching down
      to their death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warmer glow behind the black winter wood grew richer and brighter, and
      Flambeau strode on to reach it. Father Brown also quickened his stride;
      but he seemed merely absorbed in his tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such was the valour of that English thousand, and such the genius of
      their commander, that if they had at once attacked the hill, even their
      mad march might have met some luck. But the evil mind that played with
      them like pawns had other aims and reasons. They must remain in the
      marshes by the bridge at least till British corpses should be a common
      sight there. Then for the last grand scene; the silver-haired
      soldier-saint would give up his shattered sword to save further slaughter.
      Oh, it was well organised for an impromptu. But I think (I cannot prove),
      I think that it was while they stuck there in the bloody mire that someone
      doubted&mdash;and someone guessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was mute a moment, and then said: &ldquo;There is a voice from nowhere that
      tells me the man who guessed was the lover... the man to wed the old man&rsquo;s
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about Olivier and the hanging?&rdquo; asked Flambeau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olivier, partly from chivalry, partly from policy, seldom encumbered his
      march with captives,&rdquo; explained the narrator. &ldquo;He released everybody in
      most cases. He released everybody in this case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody but the general,&rdquo; said the tall man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau knit his black brows. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t grasp it all yet,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another picture, Flambeau,&rdquo; said Brown in his more mystical
      undertone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t prove it; but I can do more&mdash;I can see it. There
      is a camp breaking up on the bare, torrid hills at morning, and Brazilian
      uniforms massed in blocks and columns to march. There is the red shirt and
      long black beard of Olivier, which blows as he stands, his broad-brimmed
      hat in his hand. He is saying farewell to the great enemy he is setting
      free&mdash;the simple, snow-headed English veteran, who thanks him in the
      name of his men. The English remnant stand behind at attention; beside
      them are stores and vehicles for the retreat. The drums roll; the
      Brazilians are moving; the English are still like statues. So they abide
      till the last hum and flash of the enemy have faded from the tropic
      horizon. Then they alter their postures all at once, like dead men coming
      to life; they turn their fifty faces upon the general&mdash;faces not to
      be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flambeau gave a great jump. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Father Brown in a deep, moving voice. &ldquo;It was an English hand
      that put the rope round St. Clare&rsquo;s neck; I believe the hand that put the
      ring on his daughter&rsquo;s finger. They were English hands that dragged him up
      to the tree of shame; the hands of men that had adored him and followed
      him to victory. And they were English souls (God pardon and endure us
      all!) who stared at him swinging in that foreign sun on the green gallows
      of palm, and prayed in their hatred that he might drop off it into hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the two topped the ridge there burst on them the strong scarlet light
      of a red-curtained English inn. It stood sideways in the road, as if
      standing aside in the amplitude of hospitality. Its three doors stood open
      with invitation; and even where they stood they could hear the hum and
      laughter of humanity happy for a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not tell you more,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;They tried him in the
      wilderness and destroyed him; and then, for the honour of England and of
      his daughter, they took an oath to seal up for ever the story of the
      traitor&rsquo;s purse and the assassin&rsquo;s sword blade. Perhaps&mdash;Heaven help
      them&mdash;they tried to forget it. Let us try to forget it, anyhow; here
      is our inn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Flambeau, and was just striding into the bright,
      noisy bar when he stepped back and almost fell on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there, in the devil&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; he cried, and pointed rigidly at the
      square wooden sign that overhung the road. It showed dimly the crude shape
      of a sabre hilt and a shortened blade; and was inscribed in false archaic
      lettering, &ldquo;The Sign of the Broken Sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not prepared?&rdquo; asked Father Brown gently. &ldquo;He is the god of this
      country; half the inns and parks and streets are named after him and his
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we had done with the leper,&rdquo; cried Flambeau, and spat on the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never have done with him in England,&rdquo; said the priest, looking
      down, &ldquo;while brass is strong and stone abides. His marble statues will
      erect the souls of proud, innocent boys for centuries, his village tomb
      will smell of loyalty as of lilies. Millions who never knew him shall love
      him like a father&mdash;this man whom the last few that knew him dealt
      with like dung. He shall be a saint; and the truth shall never be told of
      him, because I have made up my mind at last. There is so much good and
      evil in breaking secrets, that I put my conduct to a test. All these
      newspapers will perish; the anti-Brazil boom is already over; Olivier is
      already honoured everywhere. But I told myself that if anywhere, by name,
      in metal or marble that will endure like the pyramids, Colonel Clancy, or
      Captain Keith, or President Olivier, or any innocent man was wrongly
      blamed, then I would speak. If it were only that St. Clare was wrongly
      praised, I would be silent. And I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They plunged into the red-curtained tavern, which was not only cosy, but
      even luxurious inside. On a table stood a silver model of the tomb of St.
      Clare, the silver head bowed, the silver sword broken. On the walls were
      coloured photographs of the same scene, and of the system of wagonettes
      that took tourists to see it. They sat down on the comfortable padded
      benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; cried Father Brown; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have some wine or beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or brandy,&rdquo; said Flambeau.

    <h2>
      The Three Tools of Death
    </h2>
    <p>
      Both by calling and conviction Father Brown knew better than most of us,
      that every man is dignified when he is dead. But even he felt a pang of
      incongruity when he was knocked up at daybreak and told that Sir Aaron
      Armstrong had been murdered. There was something absurd and unseemly about
      secret violence in connection with so entirely entertaining and popular a
      figure. For Sir Aaron Armstrong was entertaining to the point of being
      comic; and popular in such a manner as to be almost legendary. It was like
      hearing that Sunny Jim had hanged himself; or that Mr. Pickwick had died
      in Hanwell. For though Sir Aaron was a philanthropist, and thus dealt with
      the darker side of our society, he prided himself on dealing with it in
      the brightest possible style. His political and social speeches were
      cataracts of anecdotes and &ldquo;loud laughter&rdquo;; his bodily health was of a
      bursting sort; his ethics were all optimism; and he dealt with the Drink
      problem (his favourite topic) with that immortal or even monotonous gaiety
      which is so often a mark of the prosperous total abstainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The established story of his conversion was familiar on the more puritanic
      platforms and pulpits, how he had been, when only a boy, drawn away from
      Scotch theology to Scotch whisky, and how he had risen out of both and
      become (as he modestly put it) what he was. Yet his wide white beard,
      cherubic face, and sparkling spectacles, at the numberless dinners and
      congresses where they appeared, made it hard to believe, somehow, that he
      had ever been anything so morbid as either a dram-drinker or a Calvinist.
      He was, one felt, the most seriously merry of all the sons of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lived on the rural skirt of Hampstead in a handsome house, high but
      not broad, a modern and prosaic tower. The narrowest of its narrow sides
      overhung the steep green bank of a railway, and was shaken by passing
      trains. Sir Aaron Armstrong, as he boisterously explained, had no nerves.
      But if the train had often given a shock to the house, that morning the
      tables were turned, and it was the house that gave a shock to the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine slowed down and stopped just beyond that point where an angle
      of the house impinged upon the sharp slope of turf. The arrest of most
      mechanical things must be slow; but the living cause of this had been very
      rapid. A man clad completely in black, even (it was remembered) to the
      dreadful detail of black gloves, appeared on the ridge above the engine,
      and waved his black hands like some sable windmill. This in itself would
      hardly have stopped even a lingering train. But there came out of him a
      cry which was talked of afterwards as something utterly unnatural and new.
      It was one of those shouts that are horridly distinct even when we cannot
      hear what is shouted. The word in this case was &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the engine-driver swears he would have pulled up just the same if he
      had heard only the dreadful and definite accent and not the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train once arrested, the most superficial stare could take in many
      features of the tragedy. The man in black on the green bank was Sir Aaron
      Armstrong&rsquo;s man-servant Magnus. The baronet in his optimism had often
      laughed at the black gloves of this dismal attendant; but no one was
      likely to laugh at him just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      So soon as an inquirer or two had stepped off the line and across the
      smoky hedge, they saw, rolled down almost to the bottom of the bank, the
      body of an old man in a yellow dressing-gown with a very vivid scarlet
      lining. A scrap of rope seemed caught about his leg, entangled presumably
      in a struggle. There was a smear or so of blood, though very little; but
      the body was bent or broken into a posture impossible to any living thing.
      It was Sir Aaron Armstrong. A few more bewildered moments brought out a
      big fair-bearded man, whom some travellers could salute as the dead man&rsquo;s
      secretary, Patrick Royce, once well known in Bohemian society and even
      famous in the Bohemian arts. In a manner more vague, but even more
      convincing, he echoed the agony of the servant. By the time the third
      figure of that household, Alice Armstrong, daughter of the dead man, had
      come already tottering and waving into the garden, the engine-driver had
      put a stop to his stoppage. The whistle had blown and the train had panted
      on to get help from the next station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown had been thus rapidly summoned at the request of Patrick
      Royce, the big ex-Bohemian secretary. Royce was an Irishman by birth; and
      that casual kind of Catholic that never remembers his religion until he is
      really in a hole. But Royce&rsquo;s request might have been less promptly
      complied with if one of the official detectives had not been a friend and
      admirer of the unofficial Flambeau; and it was impossible to be a friend
      of Flambeau without hearing numberless stories about Father Brown. Hence,
      while the young detective (whose name was Merton) led the little priest
      across the fields to the railway, their talk was more confidential than
      could be expected between two total strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can see,&rdquo; said Mr. Merton candidly, &ldquo;there is no sense to be
      made of it at all. There is nobody one can suspect. Magnus is a solemn old
      fool; far too much of a fool to be an assassin. Royce has been the
      baronet&rsquo;s best friend for years; and his daughter undoubtedly adored him.
      Besides, it&rsquo;s all too absurd. Who would kill such a cheery old chap as
      Armstrong? Who could dip his hands in the gore of an after-dinner speaker?
      It would be like killing Father Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was a cheery house,&rdquo; assented Father Brown. &ldquo;It was a cheery
      house while he was alive. Do you think it will be cheery now he is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merton started a little and regarded his companion with an enlivened eye.
      &ldquo;Now he is dead?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the priest stolidly, &ldquo;he was cheerful. But did he
      communicate his cheerfulness? Frankly, was anyone else in the house
      cheerful but he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A window in Merton&rsquo;s mind let in that strange light of surprise in which
      we see for the first time things we have known all along. He had often
      been to the Armstrongs&rsquo;, on little police jobs of the philanthropist; and,
      now he came to think of it, it was in itself a depressing house. The rooms
      were very high and very cold; the decoration mean and provincial; the
      draughty corridors were lit by electricity that was bleaker than
      moonlight. And though the old man&rsquo;s scarlet face and silver beard had
      blazed like a bonfire in each room or passage in turn, it did not leave
      any warmth behind it. Doubtless this spectral discomfort in the place was
      partly due to the very vitality and exuberance of its owner; he needed no
      stoves or lamps, he would say, but carried his own warmth with him. But
      when Merton recalled the other inmates, he was compelled to confess that
      they also were as shadows of their lord. The moody man-servant, with his
      monstrous black gloves, was almost a nightmare; Royce, the secretary, was
      solid enough, a big bull of a man, in tweeds, with a short beard; but the
      straw-coloured beard was startlingly salted with grey like the tweeds, and
      the broad forehead was barred with premature wrinkles. He was good-natured
      enough also, but it was a sad sort of good-nature, almost a heart-broken
      sort&mdash;he had the general air of being some sort of failure in life.
      As for Armstrong&rsquo;s daughter, it was almost incredible that she was his
      daughter; she was so pallid in colour and sensitive in outline. She was
      graceful, but there was a quiver in the very shape of her that was like
      the lines of an aspen. Merton had sometimes wondered if she had learnt to
      quail at the crash of the passing trains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Father Brown, blinking modestly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that the
      Armstrong cheerfulness is so very cheerful&mdash;for other people. You say
      that nobody could kill such a happy old man, but I&rsquo;m not sure; ne nos
      inducas in tentationem. If ever I murdered somebody,&rdquo; he added quite
      simply, &ldquo;I dare say it might be an Optimist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; cried Merton amused. &ldquo;Do you think people dislike cheerfulness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People like frequent laughter,&rdquo; answered Father Brown, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
      they like a permanent smile. Cheerfulness without humour is a very trying
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked some way in silence along the windy grassy bank by the rail,
      and just as they came under the far-flung shadow of the tall Armstrong
      house, Father Brown said suddenly, like a man throwing away a troublesome
      thought rather than offering it seriously: &ldquo;Of course, drink is neither
      good nor bad in itself. But I can&rsquo;t help sometimes feeling that men like
      Armstrong want an occasional glass of wine to sadden them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merton&rsquo;s official superior, a grizzled and capable detective named Gilder,
      was standing on the green bank waiting for the coroner, talking to Patrick
      Royce, whose big shoulders and bristly beard and hair towered above him.
      This was the more noticeable because Royce walked always with a sort of
      powerful stoop, and seemed to be going about his small clerical and
      domestic duties in a heavy and humbled style, like a buffalo drawing a
      go-cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head with unusual pleasure at the sight of the priest, and
      took him a few paces apart. Meanwhile Merton was addressing the older
      detective respectfully indeed, but not without a certain boyish
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Gilder, have you got much farther with the mystery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no mystery,&rdquo; replied Gilder, as he looked under dreamy eyelids
      at the rooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is for me, at any rate,&rdquo; said Merton, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simple enough, my boy,&rdquo; observed the senior investigator, stroking
      his grey, pointed beard. &ldquo;Three minutes after you&rsquo;d gone for Mr. Royce&rsquo;s
      parson the whole thing came out. You know that pasty-faced servant in the
      black gloves who stopped the train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should know him anywhere. Somehow he rather gave me the creeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Gilder, &ldquo;when the train had gone on again, that man had
      gone too. Rather a cool criminal, don&rsquo;t you think, to escape by the very
      train that went off for the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty sure, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked the young man, &ldquo;that he really
      did kill his master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my son, I&rsquo;m pretty sure,&rdquo; replied Gilder drily, &ldquo;for the trifling
      reason that he has gone off with twenty thousand pounds in papers that
      were in his master&rsquo;s desk. No, the only thing worth calling a difficulty
      is how he killed him. The skull seems broken as with some big weapon, but
      there&rsquo;s no weapon at all lying about, and the murderer would have found it
      awkward to carry it away, unless the weapon was too small to be noticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the weapon was too big to be noticed,&rdquo; said the priest, with an
      odd little giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilder looked round at this wild remark, and rather sternly asked Brown
      what he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly way of putting it, I know,&rdquo; said Father Brown apologetically.
      &ldquo;Sounds like a fairy tale. But poor Armstrong was killed with a giant&rsquo;s
      club, a great green club, too big to be seen, and which we call the earth.
      He was broken against this green bank we are standing on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; asked the detective quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown turned his moon face up to the narrow facade of the house and
      blinked hopelessly up. Following his eyes, they saw that right at the top
      of this otherwise blind back quarter of the building, an attic window
      stood open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he explained, pointing a little awkwardly like a child,
      &ldquo;he was thrown down from there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilder frowningly scrutinised the window, and then said: &ldquo;Well, it is
      certainly possible. But I don&rsquo;t see why you are so sure about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brown opened his grey eyes wide. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a bit of rope
      round the dead man&rsquo;s leg. Don&rsquo;t you see that other bit of rope up there
      caught at the corner of the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that height the thing looked like the faintest particle of dust or
      hair, but the shrewd old investigator was satisfied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,
      sir,&rdquo; he said to Father Brown; &ldquo;that is certainly one to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost as he spoke a special train with one carriage took the curve of the
      line on their left, and, stopping, disgorged another group of policemen,
      in whose midst was the hangdog visage of Magnus, the absconded servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! they&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; cried Gilder, and stepped forward with quite a
      new alertness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the money!&rdquo; he cried to the first policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked him in the face with a rather curious expression and said:
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;At least, not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the inspector, please?&rdquo; asked the man called Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he spoke everyone instantly understood how this voice had stopped a
      train. He was a dull-looking man with flat black hair, a colourless face,
      and a faint suggestion of the East in the level slits in his eyes and
      mouth. His blood and name, indeed, had remained dubious, ever since Sir
      Aaron had &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; him from a waitership in a London restaurant, and (as
      some said) from more infamous things. But his voice was as vivid as his
      face was dead. Whether through exactitude in a foreign language, or in
      deference to his master (who had been somewhat deaf), Magnus&rsquo;s tones had a
      peculiarly ringing and piercing quality, and the whole group quite jumped
      when he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always knew this would happen,&rdquo; he said aloud with brazen blandness.
      &ldquo;My poor old master made game of me for wearing black; but I always said I
      should be ready for his funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he made a momentary movement with his two dark-gloved hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; said Inspector Gilder, eyeing the black hands with wrath,
      &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you putting the bracelets on this fellow; he looks pretty
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the sergeant, with the same odd look of wonder, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know that we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the other sharply. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you arrested him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint scorn widened the slit-like mouth, and the whistle of an
      approaching train seemed oddly to echo the mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We arrested him,&rdquo; replied the sergeant gravely, &ldquo;just as he was coming
      out of the police station at Highgate, where he had deposited all his
      master&rsquo;s money in the care of Inspector Robinson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilder looked at the man-servant in utter amazement. &ldquo;Why on earth did you
      do that?&rdquo; he asked of Magnus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep it safe from the criminal, of course,&rdquo; replied that person
      placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Gilder, &ldquo;Sir Aaron&rsquo;s money might have been safely left with
      Sir Aaron&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tail of his sentence was drowned in the roar of the train as it went
      rocking and clanking; but through all the hell of noises to which that
      unhappy house was periodically subject, they could hear the syllables of
      Magnus&rsquo;s answer, in all their bell-like distinctness: &ldquo;I have no reason to
      feel confidence in Sir Aaron&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the motionless men had the ghostly sensation of the presence of some
      new person; and Merton was scarcely surprised when he looked up and saw
      the pale face of Armstrong&rsquo;s daughter over Father Brown&rsquo;s shoulder. She
      was still young and beautiful in a silvery style, but her hair was of so
      dusty and hueless a brown that in some shadows it seemed to have turned
      totally grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful what you say,&rdquo; said Royce gruffly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll frighten Miss
      Armstrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said the man with the clear voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the woman winced and everyone else wondered, he went on: &ldquo;I am somewhat
      used to Miss Armstrong&rsquo;s tremors. I have seen her trembling off and on for
      years. And some said she was shaking with cold and some she was shaking
      with fear, but I know she was shaking with hate and wicked anger&mdash;fiends
      that have had their feast this morning. She would have been away by now
      with her lover and all the money but for me. Ever since my poor old master
      prevented her from marrying that tipsy blackguard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Gilder very sternly. &ldquo;We have nothing to do with your family
      fancies or suspicions. Unless you have some practical evidence, your mere
      opinions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll give you practical evidence,&rdquo; cut in Magnus, in his hacking
      accent. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to subpoena me, Mr. Inspector, and I shall have to
      tell the truth. And the truth is this: An instant after the old man was
      pitched bleeding out of the window, I ran into the attic, and found his
      daughter swooning on the floor with a red dagger still in her hand. Allow
      me to hand that also to the proper authorities.&rdquo; He took from his
      tail-pocket a long horn-hilted knife with a red smear on it, and handed it
      politely to the sergeant. Then he stood back again, and his slits of eyes
      almost faded from his face in one fat Chinese sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merton felt an almost bodily sickness at the sight of him; and he muttered
      to Gilder: &ldquo;Surely you would take Miss Armstrong&rsquo;s word against his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Brown suddenly lifted a face so absurdly fresh that it looked
      somehow as if he had just washed it. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, radiating innocence,
      &ldquo;but is Miss Armstrong&rsquo;s word against his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl uttered a startled, singular little cry; everyone looked at her.
      Her figure was rigid as if paralysed; only her face within its frame of
      faint brown hair was alive with an appalling surprise. She stood like one
      of a sudden lassooed and throttled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; said Mr. Gilder gravely, &ldquo;actually says that you were found
      grasping a knife, insensible, after the murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says the truth,&rdquo; answered Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next fact of which they were conscious was that Patrick Royce strode
      with his great stooping head into their ring and uttered the singular
      words: &ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;ve got to go, I&rsquo;ll have a bit of pleasure first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His huge shoulder heaved and he sent an iron fist smash into Magnus&rsquo;s
      bland Mongolian visage, laying him on the lawn as flat as a starfish. Two
      or three of the police instantly put their hands on Royce; but to the rest
      it seemed as if all reason had broken up and the universe were turning
      into a brainless harlequinade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of that, Mr. Royce,&rdquo; Gilder had called out authoritatively. &ldquo;I shall
      arrest you for assault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered the secretary in a voice like an iron gong, &ldquo;you
      will arrest me for murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilder threw an alarmed glance at the man knocked down; but since that
      outraged person was already sitting up and wiping a little blood off a
      substantially uninjured face, he only said shortly: &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true, as this fellow says,&rdquo; explained Royce, &ldquo;that Miss
      Armstrong fainted with a knife in her hand. But she had not snatched the
      knife to attack her father, but to defend him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To defend him,&rdquo; repeated Gilder gravely. &ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against me,&rdquo; answered the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice looked at him with a complex and baffling face; then she said in a
      low voice: &ldquo;After it all, I am still glad you are brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come upstairs,&rdquo; said Patrick Royce heavily, &ldquo;and I will show you the
      whole cursed thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The attic, which was the secretary&rsquo;s private place (and rather a small
      cell for so large a hermit), had indeed all the vestiges of a violent
      drama. Near the centre of the floor lay a large revolver as if flung away;
      nearer to the left was rolled a whisky bottle, open but not quite empty.
      The cloth of the little table lay dragged and trampled, and a length of
      cord, like that found on the corpse, was cast wildly across the
      windowsill. Two vases were smashed on the mantelpiece and one on the
      carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was drunk,&rdquo; said Royce; and this simplicity in the prematurely battered
      man somehow had the pathos of the first sin of a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all know about me,&rdquo; he continued huskily; &ldquo;everybody knows how my
      story began, and it may as well end like that too. I was called a clever
      man once, and might have been a happy one; Armstrong saved the remains of
      a brain and body from the taverns, and was always kind to me in his own
      way, poor fellow! Only he wouldn&rsquo;t let me marry Alice here; and it will
      always be said that he was right enough. Well, you can form your own
      conclusions, and you won&rsquo;t want me to go into details. That is my whisky
      bottle half emptied in the corner; that is my revolver quite emptied on
      the carpet. It was the rope from my box that was found on the corpse, and
      it was from my window the corpse was thrown. You need not set detectives
      to grub up my tragedy; it is a common enough weed in this world. I give
      myself to the gallows; and, by God, that is enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a sufficiently delicate sign, the police gathered round the large man
      to lead him away; but their unobtrusiveness was somewhat staggered by the
      remarkable appearance of Father Brown, who was on his hands and knees on
      the carpet in the doorway, as if engaged in some kind of undignified
      prayers. Being a person utterly insensible to the social figure he cut, he
      remained in this posture, but turned a bright round face up at the
      company, presenting the appearance of a quadruped with a very comic human
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said good-naturedly, &ldquo;this really won&rsquo;t do at all, you know.
      At the beginning you said we&rsquo;d found no weapon. But now we&rsquo;re finding too
      many; there&rsquo;s the knife to stab, and the rope to strangle, and the pistol
      to shoot; and after all he broke his neck by falling out of a window! It
      won&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;s not economical.&rdquo; And he shook his head at the ground as a
      horse does grazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspector Gilder had opened his mouth with serious intentions, but before
      he could speak the grotesque figure on the floor had gone on quite
      volubly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now three quite impossible things. First, these holes in the carpet,
      where the six bullets have gone in. Why on earth should anybody fire at
      the carpet? A drunken man lets fly at his enemy&rsquo;s head, the thing that&rsquo;s
      grinning at him. He doesn&rsquo;t pick a quarrel with his feet, or lay siege to
      his slippers. And then there&rsquo;s the rope&rdquo;&mdash;and having done with the
      carpet the speaker lifted his hands and put them in his pocket, but
      continued unaffectedly on his knees&mdash;&ldquo;in what conceivable
      intoxication would anybody try to put a rope round a man&rsquo;s neck and
      finally put it round his leg? Royce, anyhow, was not so drunk as that, or
      he would be sleeping like a log by now. And, plainest of all, the whisky
      bottle. You suggest a dipsomaniac fought for the whisky bottle, and then
      having won, rolled it away in a corner, spilling one half and leaving the
      other. That is the very last thing a dipsomaniac would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scrambled awkwardly to his feet, and said to the self-accused murderer
      in tones of limpid penitence: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, my dear sir, but your
      tale is really rubbish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Alice Armstrong in a low tone to the priest, &ldquo;can I speak to
      you alone for a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This request forced the communicative cleric out of the gangway, and
      before he could speak in the next room, the girl was talking with strange
      incisiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a clever man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you are trying to save Patrick, I
      know. But it&rsquo;s no use. The core of all this is black, and the more things
      you find out the more there will be against the miserable man I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Brown, looking at her steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she answered equally steadily, &ldquo;I saw him commit the crime
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the unmoved Brown, &ldquo;and what did he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in this room next to them,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;both doors were closed,
      but I suddenly heard a voice, such as I had never heard on earth, roaring
      &lsquo;Hell, hell, hell,&rsquo; again and again, and then the two doors shook with the
      first explosion of the revolver. Thrice again the thing banged before I
      got the two doors open and found the room full of smoke; but the pistol
      was smoking in my poor, mad Patrick&rsquo;s hand; and I saw him fire the last
      murderous volley with my own eyes. Then he leapt on my father, who was
      clinging in terror to the window-sill, and, grappling, tried to strangle
      him with the rope, which he threw over his head, but which slipped over
      his struggling shoulders to his feet. Then it tightened round one leg and
      Patrick dragged him along like a maniac. I snatched a knife from the mat,
      and, rushing between them, managed to cut the rope before I fainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Father Brown, with the same wooden civility. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the girl collapsed under her memories, the priest passed stiffly into
      the next room, where he found Gilder and Merton alone with Patrick Royce,
      who sat in a chair, handcuffed. There he said to the Inspector
      submissively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I say a word to the prisoner in your presence; and might he take
      off those funny cuffs for a minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very powerful man,&rdquo; said Merton in an undertone. &ldquo;Why do you want
      them taken off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought,&rdquo; replied the priest humbly, &ldquo;that perhaps I might have
      the very great honour of shaking hands with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both detectives stared, and Father Brown added: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell them about
      it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man on the chair shook his tousled head, and the priest turned
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Private lives are more important than public
      reputations. I am going to save the living, and let the dead bury their
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to the fatal window, and blinked out of it as he went on talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that in this case there were too many weapons and only one
      death. I tell you now that they were not weapons, and were not used to
      cause death. All those grisly tools, the noose, the bloody knife, the
      exploding pistol, were instruments of a curious mercy. They were not used
      to kill Sir Aaron, but to save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save him!&rdquo; repeated Gilder. &ldquo;And from what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From himself,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;He was a suicidal maniac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Merton in an incredulous tone. &ldquo;And the Religion of
      Cheerfulness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a cruel religion,&rdquo; said the priest, looking out of the window. &ldquo;Why
      couldn&rsquo;t they let him weep a little, like his fathers before him? His
      plans stiffened, his views grew cold; behind that merry mask was the empty
      mind of the atheist. At last, to keep up his hilarious public level, he
      fell back on that dram-drinking he had abandoned long ago. But there is
      this horror about alcoholism in a sincere teetotaler: that he pictures and
      expects that psychological inferno from which he has warned others. It
      leapt upon poor Armstrong prematurely, and by this morning he was in such
      a case that he sat here and cried he was in hell, in so crazy a voice that
      his daughter did not know it. He was mad for death, and with the monkey
      tricks of the mad he had scattered round him death in many shapes&mdash;a
      running noose and his friend&rsquo;s revolver and a knife. Royce entered
      accidentally and acted in a flash. He flung the knife on the mat behind
      him, snatched up the revolver, and having no time to unload it, emptied it
      shot after shot all over the floor. The suicide saw a fourth shape of
      death, and made a dash for the window. The rescuer did the only thing he
      could&mdash;ran after him with the rope and tried to tie him hand and
      foot. Then it was that the unlucky girl ran in, and misunderstanding the
      struggle, strove to slash her father free. At first she only slashed poor
      Royce&rsquo;s knuckles, from which has come all the little blood in this affair.
      But, of course, you noticed that he left blood, but no wound, on that
      servant&rsquo;s face? Only before the poor woman swooned, she did hack her
      father loose, so that he went crashing through that window into eternity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long stillness slowly broken by the metallic noises of Gilder
      unlocking the handcuffs of Patrick Royce, to whom he said: &ldquo;I think I
      should have told the truth, sir. You and the young lady are worth more
      than Armstrong&rsquo;s obituary notices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound Armstrong&rsquo;s notices,&rdquo; cried Royce roughly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it was
      because she mustn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t know what?&rdquo; asked Merton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that she killed her father, you fool!&rdquo; roared the other. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have
      been alive now but for her. It might craze her to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it would,&rdquo; remarked Father Brown, as he picked up his
      hat. &ldquo;I rather think I should tell her. Even the most murderous blunders
      don&rsquo;t poison life like sins; anyhow, I think you may both be the happier
      now. I&rsquo;ve got to go back to the Deaf School.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he went out on to the gusty grass an acquaintance from Highgate stopped
      him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Coroner has arrived. The inquiry is just going to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get back to the Deaf School,&rdquo; said Father Brown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I
      can&rsquo;t stop for the inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
